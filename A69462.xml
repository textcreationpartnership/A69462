            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HERE are publiſhed for thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit two compendious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts; one out of <hi>Theodorus Amydenus</hi>'s <hi>Pietas Romana,</hi> written <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1624. The other out of Mr. <hi>Carr</hi>'s <hi>Piety of Paris, Anno Domini</hi> 1666; theſe being Collections of ſeveral ſorts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable and pious works eminently flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing in the two Cities of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris;</hi> which may ſerve as an Auctary to be added to the many famous Works of our Forefathers here at home, and eſpecially in the Royal City of <hi>London:</hi> which are omitted here becauſe better known to us, and by others diligently recorded for Poſterity.</p>
            <p>The Publiſher hopes, that of ſuch a great variety of patterns of wiſely-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed wealth, as are here preſented, ſome one or other may take the Reader, and invite an imitation of them; ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as theſe relations may happily fall into the hands of perſons, that, as they are piouſly diſpoſed, ſo alſo are either
<pb facs="tcp:63921:3"/>
wealthy and ſingle; or having children, and made a competent proviſion for them, have alſo reſerved a part of their eſtate for themſelves to be expended for their own more happy living and ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the next world; and eſpecially ſo often as this <hi>Manual</hi> may come to the peruſal of ſuch, who have had beforehand ſome ſerious thoughts of our Lord's dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and counſels given to them in the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> of their <hi>laying up,</hi> whilſt here, <hi>ſome treaſure in heaven. Mat.</hi> 6.20, 21. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch will not fail them, as all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure here will; and becauſe their hearts and affections will ſurely follow, and be where their treaſure is; and woe be to thoſe whoſe affections here are not Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial. Again, Of their making them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome freinds whilſt here, <hi>with the</hi> Mammon <hi>of unrighteouſneſs</hi> (for ſo our Lord ſtiles wealth <hi>Luke</hi> 16.9.) That theſe friends, relieved here by them, may afterward receive them [<hi>i. e.</hi> when here by death they ſhall be turned out of doors] into everlaſting habitations; ſo as the poor ejected Steward was received by his Lord's debtors, whom he had before ſo prudently obliged (ſuch diſtribution of their wealth being, as the Apoſtle alſo
<pb facs="tcp:63921:3"/>
ſaith, a <hi>laying up in ſtore</hi> [or treaſuring] <hi>for themſelves a good foundation for laying hold on</hi> [or purchaſing therewith] <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after eternal life.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19.) And laſtly our Lord's counſel of their taking warning betimes from the unfortunate Builder here on earth of new barns, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.18. for his increaſed goods; for whoſe Soul the Divine Sergeants came the ſame night, whilſt he (ſaith the text) abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here in wealth, did not take care to be rich alſo towards God; and ſo all theſe, and his Soul too, loſt at once: or warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo from the miſerable rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. who having wealth and plenty given him, wherewith to relieve ſuch as poor <hi>Lazarus,</hi> rather choſe to feaſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with them; and ſo had provided in the next world not ſo much as a drop of cold water to allay his thirſt.</p>
            <p>I ſay, ſuch meditations may happily prepare ſome Readers, at leaſt welcomely to entertain ſuch propoſals as this little Book ſuggeſts to them: wherein they may ſee, what various devices many others have uſed for ſaving their Souls, with the good management of their Eſtates: and may imitate them in ſuch a Charity among this great choice as they judge
<pb facs="tcp:63921:4"/>
more neceſſary, or their means can beſt extend to.</p>
            <p>Nor hath the <hi>Publiſher</hi> any jealouſy (though this hath been ſuggeſted to him) That the <hi>Scene</hi> of ſuch publick <hi>Pieties,</hi> being made here, <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Paris,</hi> will therefore give any juſt offence. For thus he argues, That the abounding, in any Religion, of ſuch works as are, in all, allowed good and praiſe-worthy will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther provoke the reſt to a pious emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that thoſe, who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to enjoy more light of truth, will hence endeavour not to be inferiour in the true fruits thereof, Good Works. And again; That, tho our own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the chief City thereof, is very rich in variety of publick Monuments of the great Munificence of our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, yet perhaps ſome inventions of forreign Charity may be diſcovered ſo beneficial; as to be thought worthy to be tranſplanted alſo hither: and ſome new ſuccours to our neceſſitous neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours here be happily derived from them: Or, that ſuch as are alſo found here, yet now but few and rare, may be much more multiplied by occaſion of the forreign patterns thereof ſeen much more
<pb facs="tcp:63921:4"/>
frequent; or, being now more private Charities, may become more publick. And ſome publick Charities alſo here attempted and begun, but not hitherto brought to ſuch perfection as is deſired or deſigned, may, by being compared with the ſame works more compleated abroad, have their defects rectified, and ſo the work be conſummated. For true love to God, or our Neighbour, knows no limits, and uſeth to be very ingenious in multiplying new devices of ſerving them both to the uttermoſt.</p>
            <p>And, here to name ſome of thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Charities abroad, which ſeem either not to be at all, or not ſo frequent, here at home. Such ſeem to be, That Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of providing convenient Receptacles and Hoſpitals for poor helpleſs expoſed Infants, here, I am afraid, too haſtily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted with a ſmall allowance to the nurſing of ſome poor women, ſome of them of no good reputation; where part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their negligence, partly their wants, many of theſe little ones come to a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain end; and are as little inquired after, becauſe the pariſh hereby is eaſed of a charge. Again ſuch are the frequent Sodalities, or a company of pious perſons
<pb facs="tcp:63921:5"/>
united together in the proſecution of ſome or other charitable deſigns. As the Sodalities in ſeveral trades, for the reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſities of thoſe inculpably more indigent amongſt them. Sodalities for the ſuccouring the neceſſities of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wealthy-families; caſually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, and baſhful to publiſh their wants. For eaſing poor houſholders when burthened with many Children: taking theſe from them, and giving them education till they come to certain years; or are alſo fitted for an honeſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Founding Schools only for poor mens children, for teaching them their Catechiſme and to write and read, and ſo diſmiſſing them.</p>
            <p>Sodalities, For freeing and releaſing Priſoners for debt, at leaſt when it is no very great ſumme, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not ſcandalous. For viſiting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting and inſtructing Criminals con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and endeavouring to bring them to a godly end of their life. Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Apothecaries ſhops; and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the poorer ſort, when ſick, (at leaſt within ſuch a Circuit) with reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for their diſeaſes, and experienced Tenders of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:63921:5"/>Sodalities of pious Advocates for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering poor mens cauſes, defending them when juſt: and diſſwading them, when unjuſt: and for arbitrating differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
            <p>Making proviſion for the ill-married and cauſleſly deſerted by their prodigal husbands. And, For Women formerly wicked and proſtituting themſelves out of poverty; upon ſigns of their true Penitence and Reformation. Providing a place to be brought to bed and lying in, with ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary attendance hereto, for poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men great with child and deſtitute of any ſuch convenience. Providing Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for young Virgins of honeſt educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that are poor and marriageable. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the furniſhing Hoſpitals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Foundations of publick Charity, for the neceſſary overſeeing and attendance on them, with ſuch perſons as are ſingle, diſingaged, and ſequeſtred from the world, and wholly devoted to ſuch an imployment: expecting the reward on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from God, and for the preſent content with food and raiment, and ſerving for conſcience, not gain. For nothing can proſper where Avarice is not firſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. To which alſo is frequently ſuper-added
<pb facs="tcp:63921:6"/>
the voluntary attendance of other devout perſons of Quality, and that of both Sexes from abroad, habited ſuitably for ſuch an imployment. A thing fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently practiſed, and by cuſtome not wondred or bluſhed at; with great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, as well to theſe Viſitants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves (ſo learning humility, tender-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and ſuffering ſeveral mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from ſuch pitiful ſpectacles of mans miſery): As for the more plentiful ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and relief of thoſe Miſerables, who are often made partakers, together with their Service, of their Charity and Alms.</p>
            <p>Many more might be named, more common abroad, leſs frequent at home, in all places commendable; the ſilence in which here may invite you to make a further ſearch for them in the following Relations. Unleſs I ſhould here alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that moſt pious and heroical deſign, not long ſince attempted in <hi>Paris,</hi> of an univerſal remedy and cure of common Beggars ſorted into ſeveral Bodies or Claſſes of them, Men, Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, aged, able, impotent: received in ſeveral ſpacious houſes.</p>
            <p>One of them is ſaid to be capable of
<pb facs="tcp:63921:6"/>
four or five thouſand perſons. In which Houſes were lodged <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 1666. about eight thouſand of both Sexes.</p>
            <p>Thoſe able being kept cloſe to their work and exerciſes of divers trades. The younger ſort trained up in ſuch manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures as may always yeild them an honeſt livelihood: The whole governed and adminiſtred by pious Clergy, and other ſingle perſons of much fidelity, wholly devoting themſelves to this, tho mean and toilſome, yet moſt charitable, Service.</p>
            <p>Now if againſt ſuch multiplicity of benefactions ſuted to ſo various neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties it be objected, That the ſuper-abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of ſuch Charities in theſe places increaſeth thoſe that need them, and muſt make them more careleſs in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, when they foreſee themſelves provided for in want: Firſt, This ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may be made againſt the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of any Charity whatever; even that, if any be, practiſed by the objectors. For what giving can there be that may not be ſaid to incourage men to beg and ask? And what good can be named that ſome evil <hi>per accidens</hi> may not be found to come of it? Secondly, None can be

blamed for, or indeed excuſed from, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the preſent wants of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, tho, theſe ſhould be many times viciouſly contracted; becauſe the perſon, however qualified, yet being irrecover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as to his former fortunes without ſuch relief muſt periſh. Therefore Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity looks <hi>de facto</hi> chiefly at mens wants, however incurred by them: who tho alſo falling into theſe by their fault, yet when in them, may be truly penitent; or, not being ſo, are not to be deſerted in miſery becauſe they are not Saints. Thirdly, As ſome, by their fault, ſo others fall into miſery without it; and Charity in ſuch caſes ſtill is inclined to think the beſt: And ſafer, that ten unworthy be helped, than one truly needy and deſerving miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry for want of it. Fourthly, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are ſuch Charities ordinarily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but that there is ſome choice uſed in the objects thereof; and thoſe perſons preferred that ſeem more to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve compaſſion. Fifthly, Many other good laws in theſe places are made for reſtraint of theſe vices that bring men to penury; which if rightly executed, there will be the fewer faultily needy.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, How much ſoever common
<pb facs="tcp:63921:7"/>
Charities abound, men are naturally ſo ambitious of ſelf ſubſiſtency and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency on others, as that none wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and with deſign, will caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly on other mens Alms: eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where can be expected nothing more than neceſſaries, and receipt into a place, where there are laws to reſtrain exorbitances, as well as Charity to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour wants. We ſee how ſollicitouſly common Beggars decline ſuch relief. Seventhly, Whatever plentiful proviſion of publick Charities is made in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, yet theſe can never abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely equal all neceſſities (though it were to be wiſhed they might ſo:) And therefore every one ought to be jealous, that they may not extend to himſelf; nor, for ſuch common ſuccours, releaſe his care and induſtry for his own ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence. But if the bowels of Charity could be ſo far enlarged to all conditions of men, as that none at all might fear want, the world would ſtill have the more not to complain of, but give thanks for. And we have an admirable prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and pattern thereof in the primitive Oeconomy practiſed by the Apoſtles (in thoſe firſt great effuſions of the holy
<pb facs="tcp:63921:8"/>
Spirit) and recommended <hi>Act.</hi> 2.44. and again <hi>Act.</hi> 4.32. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which more abound in theſe works of mercy to all their Neighbours, ſeem ſo much nearer to approach to that primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Copy left us by the holieſt of men.</p>

This <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent</hi> left behind him in <hi>Rome</hi> two remarkable Monuments of his charity towards neceſſitous perſons.

The other in this place, where Pope <hi>Leo</hi> 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 851. having finiſhed that part of the City called after his name <hi>Borgo Leonino,</hi> built therein a Church dedicated to the perpetual <hi>Virgin</hi> St. <hi>Mary.</hi> And <hi>Anno</hi> 1204. This <hi>Innocent</hi> the third adjoyned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto <hi>another Hoſpital;</hi> this which we are now treating of. And as he put the firſt Hoſpital under the care of a certain religious order then newly inſtituted by him; ſo did he this under another Order likewiſe approved by him; whoſe Title is that of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out changing the Title of the Churches dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin in <hi>Saſſia.</hi>

Now tho, in the Bull of <hi>Innocent, expoſed Infants,</hi> which are here generally received and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, are not particularly mentioned; yet it ſeems ſuch alſo were meant by the clauſe added, <hi>and other objects of Pity:</hi> Which clauſe was alſo in the Bull of <hi>Nich.</hi> 4. <hi>Anno</hi> 1291. And at laſt was ſo declared by the Bull
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63921:11"/>
of <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth. <hi>An.</hi> 1476. And becauſe none ſhould imagine, that the Reception of ſuch Infants did begin firſt under his Pontificate, there is ſet up in the Hall, being a great and fair room, many Inſcriptions, and the Pictures of many dead Infants brought out of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring <hi>Tyber,</hi> and laid at Pope <hi>Innocents</hi> feet; And an <hi>Angel</hi> ſaid to adviſe him from heaven to make ſome proviſion againſt ſuch miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages.</p>
                           <p>Hence all expoſed Infants are here received by order from the Pope; and being once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived are never turned off again or forſaken. For the Males, as ſoon as they are grown up to it, are taught husbandry or ſome other Mechanical Trade, and ſome made Scholars; as the Genius of every one is diſcerned to be addicted: and what they take to therein they may be always furthered if they will. As for the Females they are delivered into the hands of Nurſes and honeſt Matrons to be trained up; and being grown of age are compelled either to to become <hi>Nuns,</hi> or to be beſtowed by the <hi>Houſe in Marriage.</hi> And if they become Widdows, are received again into the Hoſpital, if they deſire it, very freely, as the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the place.</p>
                           <p>Time indeed, that ſilently eats all things, had much decayed what <hi>Innocent</hi> had built; when Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth. 1471. ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to rebuild all from the very foundations, and amplified it to a magnificent State; which went on ſtill augmenting by the munificence
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63921:12"/>
of ſeveral ſucceeding Popes. <hi>Leo</hi> X, <hi>Paul</hi> III, <hi>Pius</hi> IV, <hi>Pius</hi> V, <hi>Gregory</hi> XIV. In grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to which liberalities, are ſet up diſtinct Inſcriptions. But to return to the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great Hoſpital, and the Church ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining: There ſerve and officiate in the Church men of a religious order wearing a white Croſs on their breaſts; who likewiſe are ſet over the Hoſpital to govern it, and take care of its In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes, Rents, and Revenues. Theſe have an innumerable company of ſervants that receive wages under them.</p>
                           <p>Over all is a Maſter with the title of a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendator,</hi> who now for ſome years hath been ſtill choſen out of the chief Prelates of the whole Court.</p>
                           <p>The Church is all built of <hi>Tivoli</hi> Stone beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly adorned with pictures, and all other ſacred furniture, that may advance the devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of chriſtians; the Hoſpital or Common-houſe for reception of ſtrangers is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great and capacious, having within its precincts divers Palaces with their diſtinct Courts.</p>
                           <p>In one apartment are maintained forty Nurſes that are imployed in giving ſuck, and nurſing up the <hi>Infants</hi> abandoned by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; beſides theſe, others, which for their exceeding great number amount ſometimes to two thouſand, are put abroad to nurſe at ſuch a rate; for here they refuſe none, Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards, or Legitimates, if in a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63921:12"/>In the ſecond apartment are maintained about four hundred and fifty of the ſame chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, after they are a little grown; and then they have their maſters and ſervants to teach them the Chriſtian Doctrine, to read and write, and ſome beginnings of thoſe Trades they ſeem moſt inclined to; That at twelve or thirteen years old they may be put forth, and bound thereto in order to ſubſiſt of themſelves.</p>
                           <p>In the third apartment are kept above five hundred of the girls: and are there cloiſtered in the Monaſtery dedicated to St. <hi>Tecla,</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the precincts of the ſaid Hoſpital; where they are educated by fourteen Nuns of St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>'s Order in the diſcipline of that <hi>Rule,</hi> and by many other Miſtreſſes, in all the arts and skills proper for women; and every year forty of them are given in marriage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Pope <hi>Sixtus;</hi> which is done ſtill on the Wedneſday in <hi>Whitſun</hi>-week. For then all the Bridegrooms are invited to a ſumptuous feaſt; and the Virgins having their dowries and other proviſions ſutable to their new condition given to them, are each of them ſent away with their husbands.</p>
                           <p>And that the Bridegrooms may before hand ſometimes ſee thoſe, whom they will make choice of, for their Brides; The <hi>Virgins</hi> are led forth thrice a year in proceſſion.</p>
                           <p>Firſt on the Sunday next to St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s day when they go to St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, next on St. <hi>Mark</hi>'s day; beginning from his Church the Proceſſion of the Litanies, and ending it at St.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63921:13"/>
                              <hi>Peter</hi>'s; Whither alſo they go forth a third time on Whit-monday: the <hi>Volto Santo</hi> being there ſhewn them at their firſt and laſt Proceſſion.</p>
                           <p>The fourth apartment contains the ſick in a lower gallery, ſo long and ſo large, that 'tis capable of a thouſand ſingle beds, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the ſummer are all filled with ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And on the outſide thereof next the ſtreets runs along a Portico or open Cloiſter, the full length of the Gallery; into which at ſeveral doors come forth thoſe that tend and ſerve the ſick after they have done with them; and cleanſed all within, to take by turns a little air and refreſhment: tho, the Gallery it ſelf of the ſick is always kept moſt ſweet and neat.</p>
                           <p>Oppoſite to this Gallery on the other ſide of the Court ſtand the ſeveral chambers for ſuch ſick perſons; whoſe infirmities are of that quality that it is not fit to lodge them with others, but each muſt have a chamber apart.</p>
                           <p>Croſs the upper end of the Gallery below are ſeveral roomes, as ſo many Apothecaries ſhops the beſt furniſhed of any in <hi>Rome</hi> of all things neceſſary for diſeaſed perſons. Over theſe are ſeveral Chambers well furniſhed and fitted for ſuch perſons of quality as falling ſick have not the conveniency to be ſo well looked to and tended elſewhere. For theſe Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, hath built a Palace apart, as this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial teſtifies.</p>

                           <p>In this great building are alſo two other places of note. The one is the Palace of the <hi>Commendator</hi> and his family, which conſiſts of ſome Ninety in number: All which have their employments, offices and charges about the ſick; He going himſelf often to viſit them. And, beſides many appointed Phyſitians and Surgeons; who in their turns, if need be, watch whole nights with their patients (for nothing is omitted that may conduce to the health of the body.) Beſides the religious men of that order, who are perpetually upon the place, and other ſervants that are paid their wages for it, There are many Monks and Fryars of all orders, that dayly viſit the ſick; not only exhorting them to patience, and feeding their ſouls with the word of God, but bringing them likewiſe early fruits and the firſt of all ſorts that the ſeaſon there affords; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſweetmeats and other refreſhing things, coming from forreign parts.</p>
                           <p>Among theſe perſons are chiefly the Prieſts of the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>Oratory</hi> founded not many years ſince, by the authority of St. <hi>Philip Neri;</hi> whoſe inſtitute and approved vertues require to be ſpoken of more particularly in another place.</p>

                              <pb n="8" facs="tcp:63921:14"/>The other place is the Church (touch'd upon before) together with the chambers adjoining for the foremention'd Religious, and for the other Prieſts who aſſiſt the ſick. For beſides the <hi>Penitentiary</hi> (who aſſoon as any ſick perſons are brought, in the firſt place heareth their confeſſions) others adminiſter the Sacraments to them, That of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and when the caſe requires it, that of <hi>Extreame <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction:</hi> others accompany the departing Souls with the Church's prayers and recommendations.

                           <p>The yearly Revenue of the whole is very great, and amounts to near a hundred thouſand Gold Crowns (every Crown being worth 7. <hi>ſh:</hi> 6. <hi>d.</hi>) that is: About thirty ſeven thouſand five hundred pounds Sterling <hi>per Annum.</hi>

                           <p>This Hoſpital is a double one; one part for men, the other for women; and a ſtreet or publick-way between both: either of them are ſerved by miniſters and attendants of their own ſex.

                           <p>Here are received, as in the other Hoſpitals abovenamed, in ſeveral apartments both men and women of what condition ſoever, if they be ſick of Fevers, or have any wounds or ſores; there they have Phyſicians, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and ſervants to attend them.</p>

ſhrunck that labour with the <hi>Hernia,</hi> and ſuch incurable diſeaſes; whence it is named, <hi>The Hospital of Incurables:</hi> A Work of very great charity and therefore contributed unto by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worthy men; among whom the Marble ſtone, that is in the Eaſt Church (for the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hath two Churches belonging to it, this, and another at the Weſt, end) records <hi>Anthony</hi> of <hi>Burgos.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But Fryer <hi>Clement</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Ara Caeli</hi> left this Hoſpital as his heir to his whole eſtate; as a table in that Church for a memorial ſhews.</p>
                           <p>Nor was this Hoſpital a little benefited by <hi>Bartholomew de la Cueva</hi> of St. <hi>Croſs</hi> in <hi>Hieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> as appears in a like Marble table. This Hoſpital received yet more advantage by <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowick de Torres</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Salernum</hi> as is in a like Marble table. Beſides theſe Cardinals ſpoken of and other great Prelates, many there have been of the inferior rank both men and women (whoſe names it were tedious to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite) who by charitable Legacies have much promoted this famous work of Chriſtian piety, which I ſet not down here for brevity ſake; yet muſt not forget that of <hi>Paul</hi> the third; of which there is extant a large Memorial in a Marble ſtone inſerted in the wall of the Weſt Church.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly to all theſe ſucceeds <hi>Antonius Maria Salviatus</hi> the Cardinal, a man of a princely mind, as the ſtately Monuments of it teſtify. He razed down that Church which we called the Eaſt Church, and raiſed another, a moſt
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63921:18"/>
magnificent one, in its place; a peice of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſtructure, great capacity and royal furniture as is to be ſeen; He increaſed the revenue of this Hoſpital very liberally.</p>
                           <p>The Church is adorned with very rich fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture; the Divine office therein performed by twenty four Prieſts and ſix Acolytes.</p>
                           <p>The ſick have many to attend upon them. The whole Hoſpital with all its revenue is governed by that Sodality which heretofore was named St. <hi>Maria del Popolo;</hi> becauſe it was inſtituted in the Church of that Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but now it is tranſlated to this we ſpeak of, and ſo intitled: The Sodality of St. <hi>James</hi> for the <hi>Incurables.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The order they uſe in this houſe of charity is moſt accurate: I had it from the Sodality it ſelf moſt particularly ſet down, but too long to be inſerted here, where brevity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</p>
                           <p>Beſides the ordinary care uſed about the ſick, once every two years they make a Decoction that is very chargeable, for ſuch as have that miſerable diſeaſe, which the vulgar calumniouſly call the <hi>French pox</hi> (for that goes too amongſt the Incurables) and ſo diſtribute it among thoſe that are ſick thereof.</p>
                           <p>The houſes, that were added to the old Hoſpital by the Cardinal <hi>Salviati,</hi> are very large ones and bear his Inſcription. The beds here made for the incurable perſons are no leſs than a hundred, and more if there be need.</p>

                           <p>
                              <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63921:19"/>Out of all this it appears, that there is ſcarce any ſort of relief and eaſement to be imagined for the poor ſick: which is not in all its kinds abundantly practiſed in this City, the very Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Charity.</p>
                           <p>Here alſo come fitly to be ſpoken of, thoſe two Cardinal <hi>Burgheſe</hi> and <hi>Lodoviſius.</hi> The firſt of whom hath furniſhed up an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's ſhop, abounding with all ſorts of Drugs, and Phyſick, and Remedies for the uſe of all the poor in that pariſh where his Palace ſtands.</p>
                           <p>The other hath provided the like ſhop, but far greater; ſo that it may ſupply all ſorts of remedies, for all ſorts of diſeaſes, <hi>gratis</hi> to the poor of all the City and its Suburbs; and to that purpoſe hath alotted a yearly revenue of two thouſand four hundred Golden Crowns, that is about nine hundred pounds ſterling.</p>
                           <p>And thus much of the Hoſpitals and places of refreſhment for thoſe that are ſick, or lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.

                           <p>Theſe therefore maintain a Prieſt for her Altar: and having many years perſevered in this devotion they came at length to make up a confraternity <hi>An.</hi> 1598. and had the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to deliver a Priſoner from death on the ſame Feaſt. Whereon alſo they contribute ſome Dowries for marrying-off ſome of their poor Maids. The place is united to the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> which maintains a pariſh Prieſt there, for thoſe Souls that live ſcattered in the Vineyards thereabouts. The Alms for maintenance of the ſick are partly given by the Popes <hi>Major-Domo,</hi> and partly gathered from the paſſengers in that Highway.</p>
                           <p>The other <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> or Hoſpital for Lepers, is within the Walls at the foot of the <hi>Aventine</hi>-Hill in <hi>via oſtienſi;</hi> and was erected by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Hoſpital to gather here the alms of ſuch as viſited the ſeven Churches.

                        <p>The Church it ſelf indeed is an excellent peice, all of <hi>Tivoli</hi> ſtone; in the building whereof were expended about fifty thouſand Crowns. All being contributions of Charity.</p>
                        <p>By it is the Hoſpital, common to all afflicted with Sores and Fevers, but more particularly deſigned for Bakers; becauſe raiſed upon their purſe, altho the inſcription ſays nothing of it;</p>
                        <q>Hoſpit. Societat. Divae <hi>Mariae</hi> Laureti.</q>
                        <p>The care of the place totally belongs to that Sodality. Thirty beds for the uſe of the ſick they furniſh; but on an occaſion they add more daily. All things that can be thought of neceſſary, or convenient for recovering of health they there ſupply.</p>
                        <p>Next the <hi>German Bakers,</hi> of which ſort there is no ſmall number in this City, have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have an Hoſpital too, for their ſick, adjoyning to the Church of St. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> near <hi>Campus Florae:</hi> the Church is well adorned with holy Utenſils, and the Hoſpital with beds and other neceſſaries for the ſick, good diet and attendance.</p>

                           <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63921:23"/>Again for the ſervants belonging to the Popes Family, (there being a very great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them) about the year 1537, There was a kind of a Body or pious Sodality erected out of them; which, behind St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church at the entrance of the old <hi>Circus</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> built up a Temple to St. <hi>Martha,</hi> and by it an Hoſpital for the ſervants of the Courtiers, which fell ſick, and could not be well looked unto in the Palace it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>This Temple, by reaſon of the many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences granted unto it by ſeveral Popes, is much frequented by the devouter ſort; that hardly there is one that viſits St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church which doth not likewiſe go unto this of which we ſpeak. The Hoſpital is abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly furniſhed with beds and other neceſſaries for treating of the ſick.</p>
                        <p>In the year of our Lord 1580. the <hi>Coach-men</hi> and <hi>Carmen</hi> joined together, and out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſtituted a Sodality of the better ſort, which built an Hoſpital in <hi>Campus Martius</hi> near <hi>Tyber,</hi> onely for ſick <hi>Coachmen</hi> and <hi>Carmen.</hi> Here therefore are entertained all the infirm of theſe Profeſſions. Nor are they diſmiſſed until they be known to have recovered their former health, ſo as to be able to drive their Coaches or Carts, and govern their horſes. Of theſe ſorts of men there is no ſmall number in <hi>Rome,</hi> ſince the very Coaches and Chariots of the Gentry exceed two thouſand, not reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning Carts or Country Waggons.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Fourthly, Of the Hoſpitals for Orphan Boys and Girls having no Parents.</head>
                        <p>LET us go on to ſee how <hi>Rome,</hi> the Nurſe of all ſorts of people, is never wanting to aſſiſt the needy of what condition or age ſoever, but takes care of them aſſoon as born, and once received into her care, foſters them up as long as they live, and being dead pays their funerals.</p>
                        <p>In all great and populous Cities there uſes to be a great number of Infants expoſed; not ſo much by the fault of the mothers, as for the great poverty of their parents: Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there was a certain place appointed for ſuch in this City, Theſe poor Infants were puniſhed not for their own, but for their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents faults or fortunes, and almoſt all periſhed miſerably. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by an Angel, built that Hoſpital of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> in <hi>Saxia,</hi> for theſe Innocents, as we ſhewed before.</p>
                        <p>If any miſery befall perſons under age and young, that they are not able to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by their own work, and withal have loſt both father and mother: The City hath alſo two houſes for ſuch Orphans, the one for males, and the other for females.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="28" facs="tcp:63921:24"/>The firſt had its beginning in the year 1540. by a <hi>Sodality</hi> of many pious Citizens of <hi>Rome</hi> then inſtituted; who diſliking, That young Boys ſhould run idling up and down the City, thought it fitter that ſome Hoſpital ſhould be built for them: which good work <hi>Paul</hi> the third, who then was Pope, much encouraged, and aſſigned a place for this Fabrick near the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s Temple, cloſe by the pariſh Church of St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Acquiro</hi> of the <hi>Viſitation,</hi> granting that Church to the uſe of the Sodality and Hoſpital. After this firſt Church was pulled down, and the Sodality built up another moſt magnificent, and on a larger plot of ground, adjoining to it a very ſpacious houſe by means of the alms of good people, to keep the Boys in. To this work much was contributed by the often mentioned <hi>Antonius Maria Salviatus</hi> the Cardinal, who by his wonted liberality hath much encreaſed the revenue of the Hoſpital.</p>
                        <p>As for thoſe Lads, who are apt for learning, the ſame Cardinal hath built a very magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Colledge apart for them, and largely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed it.</p>
                        <p>The care of the Church, of the Servants, and indeed of the whole Hoſpital, is intruſted to the foreſaid Sodality: Who are very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to ſearch into the diſpoſitions and incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the youths, and ſo to make choice of them ſeverally, to apply every one to ſuch a courſe of life as fits beſt his own Genius.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond of thoſe houſes is for female Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63921:24"/>
for it being not convenient for Boys and Girls to live promiſcuouſly in the ſame houſe; The Girls have their Hoſpital in another place, and indeed a very large one, near to the Church of <hi>Sanctorum quatuor Coronatorum;</hi> which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore is ſaid to be the Palace of the Popes. Herein are a very great number of ſuch Maids, who are inſtructed and taught, and ruled and governed by ſome <hi>Nuns</hi> of St. <hi>Bennet</hi>'s order; who are there likewiſe cloiſtered up. The Girls, being grown of age, receive their Dowries from the ſame Sodality, and ſo are either marryed-off, or, if they have a mind to it, enter into ſome <hi>Nunnery.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now becauſe in theſe houſes for Orphans, according to the laws of the Foundations, none are to be received but ſuch as are deprived of both parents; The <hi>Roman</hi> charity cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent it ſelf to leave unprovided for, other young Boys and Girls, who perhaps have but one pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent left them; or if both, yet ſuch as are either decrepit, lame, or blind, or impotent by ſome other defect, that they cannot maintain their children; even for ſuch alſo hath <hi>Rome,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Nurſe of all ſorts of poor, taken care with a very provident liberality.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>John Leonard</hi> of <hi>Sicily</hi> was a man, as his Works ſhew him, of a very good mind and ſingular charity towards the poor. He having been in his more youthful days a Gentleman-Uſher in this City, and obſerving therein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny boys idly to run up and down, had pity upon them, and got together a very great
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63921:25"/>
number of them, and lodging them himſelf in divers borrowed houſes, maintained them as well as he could for many years, with ſuch Alms as he procured from the charity of good people. He was one that had no learning, and therefore by an Irony was wont to ſtile himſelf the <hi>lettered John,</hi> and the boys of his inſtitution ſtill retain the name of <hi>Literati.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This holy <hi>Inſtitute</hi> in a very ſhort time found many Favourers. Who growing into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, bought a very large houſe for the bringing up of theſe boys, near <hi>Domitian</hi>'s Arch: To which is added a little Chappel.</p>
                        <p>This houſe is now endowed with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, but nothing at all competent for the maintenance of ſo great a multitude. Hence it is that the younger boys are led about ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times through the ſtreets of the City by one that governs them, ſinging their prayers and praiſes to God and the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin,</hi> in a certain childiſh harmony; thereby to beg alms of good people: And the greater being ſet to manual labour get victuals for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their Companions: in ſumme all are imployed to a good end.</p>
                        <p>That which is moſt commendable in this work, is the good education and training up of poor children, whereby they are timely in their ſlippery age eſtranged from the common vices of youth.</p>
                        <p>The ſame <hi>Leonard</hi> had gathered together Girls too; but becauſe he alone was not able to go through with the care of both Boys and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63921:25"/>
Girles he deſerted this deſign. Altho, the Maids were afterwards diſpoſed of to ſeveral perſons: And in the year 1595. found a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Patron, namely Cardinal <hi>Hieronimus Ruſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuccius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This Cardinal having bought many houſes near the Church of St. <hi>Euphemia</hi> in <hi>Trajani Forum,</hi> did, as as they ſay, by the perſwaſion of venerable <hi>Ceſar Baronius</hi> (who afterwards was Cardinal) build out of them a very large houſe to receive all theſe Maids gathered now together from thoſe ſeveral places wherein they lived before diſperſed. And over them he ſet honeſt Matrons, who taking the care of their Education, ſhould inſtruct them in all ways of Religion and Holineſs. The leſſer among theſe, as before the leſſer among the Boys, are led about the town ſinging alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to implore the benevolence of the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; and the greater are kept to their Needle, and other female imployments. When any are grown of age, by order of their Governors, they are either to be marryed or profeſſed Nuns.</p>
                        <p>Over this houſe are ſet, by order of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal the Popes Vicar, ſome grave Prieſts; but the ſupreme authority reſts in the Cardinal Vicar.</p>
                        <p>The number of Boys is uſually about three hundred, and ſo likewiſe is that of the Maids. This inſtitute and the Congregation that looks to it, hath for Protector the Cardinal <hi>Ludo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicus Ludoviſius;</hi> who often ſupplies both
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63921:26"/>
houſes with his liberality according as their exigencies require.</p>
                        <p>There are never wanting in great Cities wicked mothers; who, never having affected chaſtity, make their Daughters like themſelves; and expoſe them to be abuſed for a ſmall gain, and ſometimes againſt their wills.</p>
                        <p>That the wickedneſs of ſuch wretches might be prevented, there hath been by the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of St. <hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi> inſtituted in the City a <hi>Sodality, Anno</hi> 1540. whoſe care it is with all ſagacity to ſearch out for the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch infamous women; and having found them, to take all from ten to twelve years old from the power and tuition of their treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mothers, and to place them in a Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery built for that purpoſe, there to be taught and trained up by grave <hi>Nuns</hi> in all Chriſtian diſcipline. When they come to be marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they have provided for them husbands, or if they had rather vails; in the mean time they are maintained at the charge of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery.</p>
                        <p>There is a very ſtately Church all built of <hi>Tivoli</hi> ſtone, and dedicated to St. <hi>Catherine</hi> de <hi>Funari,</hi> added to this Monaſtery by Cardinal <hi>Frederick Caeſius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Porto,</hi> as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription over the great gate thereof declares.</p>
                        <p>For the better education of theſe poor Girls, the <hi>Auguſtine Nuns</hi> take care of them.</p>
                        <p>This Monaſtery is governed by a Sodality, conſiſting of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens, the very prime of them; whether you conſider their extracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, eſtates or vertues,</p>

                        <p>MAtrimony the moſt indiſſoluble bond of humane ſociety (wherein is found that chief and inexplicable freindſhip and unity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and wife) yet is not unoften by the fault of the parties undone, cut aſunder, or at leaſt looſened: namely when this indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual converſation and cohabiting is injured by a ſtubborn contumacy; for hence grow anger, ſtrifes, and at the laſt a ſeparation from the marriage-bed; which is cauſed by the ill condition ſometimes of the man, ſometimes of the woman. But leaſt women ſhould incur the ignominy of being diſhoneſt, when they live ſeparate from their husbands, there is provided a houſe for entertainment of ſuch ill-yoked perſons: wherein they are received, until ſuch time as they are fully reconciled to their husbands, or their husbands to them.</p>
                        <p>This houſe is called <hi>Domus Pia,</hi> and ſtands near to the Church belonging to the Monaſtery of St. <hi>Clare.</hi> Which Church on one hand hath St. <hi>Clare</hi>'s Monaſtery, and on the other, this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63921:27"/>
houſe. So that they have a kind of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion together; but yet no farther than in the uſe of the Church ſtanding between them.</p>
                        <p>The care of this houſe is committed to a Sodality of the prime Citizens of <hi>Rome;</hi> as likewiſe is that of St. <hi>Clare</hi>'s Nunnery, of which in due place.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Secondly, The charitable Proviſion for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentant Strumpets.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither are the Whores themſelves (of which by the perverſe and vicious nature of mankind, there is too great a number in great Cities) deprived of the <hi>Roman</hi> charity, if they once come to repent themſelves.</p>
                        <p>For near <hi>Antoninus</hi> his <hi>Forum</hi> is there built for ſuch, a very large Monaſtery dedicated to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen:</hi> Wherein are received all ſuch, as repenting themſelves of their paſt voluptuouſneſs, are diſpoſed to dedicate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the reſt of their lives to God. Here ſuch make profeſſion of a regular courſe, and obſerve the monaſtical Diſcipline ſo exactly, and with ſo great conſtancy; that it is a kind of miracle, that women accuſtomed to a looſer ſort of life, ſhould now be kept under ſo ſtrict a rule.</p>
                        <p>A great part of the Fabrick of this Monaſtery was added by Cardinal <hi>Peter Aldobrandini,</hi> but in a few years after ſuffering by fire was again magnificently re-edified by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth.</p>
                        <p>The care of this Monaſtery belongs to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63921:27"/>
Nobility both of the City and Court, joining together in a Sodality; which ſuffers not the penitents to want any thing.</p>
                        <p>The number of theſe women amounts at this day to three hundred. They ſay <hi>Paul</hi> the fifth, at that time, when he viſited this Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery lately then burnt, and ſaw ſo many ſigns of true repentance, ſhed tears, and ſtood as it were amazed at the terrible penances and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſanctity practiſed by theſe women.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe none are admitted here unleſs they firſt make profeſſion to be perpetually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, after which there is no recalling; and it is likely that ſome, that have made that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, may afterwards come to repent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and others, that have hot yet made it, may be deterred from ever making it by the indiſpenſableneſs thereof. Therefore Frier <hi>Dominick de Jeſu Maria,</hi> one of the reformed <hi>Carmelites,</hi> whom the vulgar term Diſcalceat or unſhod, hath lately out of the alms of pious people, built another large Monaſtery, wherein ſuch women are received, as changing to an honeſter courſe of life, deſire yet to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they can go through with the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of themſelves: and upon tryal have time to deliberate whether they will make that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in that other houſe, or elſe continue here as long as they can live ſingle.</p>
                        <p>

                        </p>
                        <p>We have ſeen how the <hi>Roman</hi> charity hath

made proviſion for all, of all ages and degrees, that need their help. And it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that it ſhould fail them, who fail through age.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore Pope <hi>Sixtus Quintus,</hi> a munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Prince, hath built a very large Hoſpital and endowed it with a great yearly Revenue for old people, and for the blind, lame, maimed, or made impotent by any other natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſo that they cannot labour. Over this Hoſpital is ſet a Sodality of certain honeſt men; who are to take care of all things, and to judge of ſuch as are fit to be received.</p>
                        <p>They admit alike men and women, but in ſeveral apartments, and maintain all in decent diet and cloathing as long as they live.</p>

                        <p>AT the foot of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> near the Church of St. <hi>Peter</hi> (the Prince of the Apoſtles) at the Weſt end there ſtands a fair Church dedicated to the bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> and near it a large Church yard, wherein none but Strangers and Pilgrims are buried.</p>
                        <p>Behind this Church is a large houſe, wherein by the appointment of ſeveral Popes, thirteen poor people are daily dined by two Prieſts
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63921:28"/>
that have that charge. It is piouſly believed that this cuſtome came down from St. <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, that moſt holy Pope; who uſually entertaining twelve poor men every day, had the honour once to treat for a thirteenth poor perſon our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, whence this number hath ever ſince been religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly obſerved, to this day.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this charity there is diſtributed by the Popes liberality Bread and Wine in great abundance, unto two thouſand poor people, on every Friday, in honour of our Lord's Paſſion.</p>
                        <p>The Convent of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> gives every day two loaves of bread a peice to as many poor people as come thither for it.</p>
                        <p>The Hoſpital of our holy <hi>Saviour,</hi> near the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church, beſtows every day upon every one of the poor, as much bread as will ſuffice each of them for a day.</p>
                        <p>The like is done by the Convent of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Via Oſtienſi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Hoſpital of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> gives bread and wine every evening to a great multitude of poor.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe the forementioned Alms are not given but to ſuch as come themſelves to demand them; and many, becauſe they live afar off, or becauſe they come of honeſt fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies reduced into povery, are aſhamed to go from door to door to ask an alms; for theſe, who are ſtiled the <hi>ſhame-fac'd poor,</hi> an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious proviſion is made by the Sodality

(which we ſpake of above) of the Holy twelve Apoſtles. There is placed in that Church a little Desk under lock and key, into which at a chink are thruſt in the Petitions, wherein the neceſſitous perſon expreſſeth his wants, and ſets down his place of habitation. Thrice every week this Desk is opened by the officers, the Petitions read, and ſome of the Sodality diſpatched away to find out the Supplicants, and to releive them according to the quality of their indigency.</p>
                        <p>The like order is obſerved by that Sodality of Charity, ſet up under Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, in the Church of St. <hi>Hierome,</hi> near to the Palace of <hi>Farneſi:</hi> This Sodality there diſtributes every Saturday a great quantity of bread to to the poor; and to thoſe modeſt beggars, what money the confraternity thinks fit; by whoſe piety the largeſs hath been maintained and increaſed.</p>
                        <p>Beſides all theſe munificences and charities the Pope monthly diſtributes to the Convents of <hi>Mendicants,</hi> and to other ſhame fac'd poor, great ſumms of monies, under the name of common charity; which are ſtill encreaſed as the exigents of times require; and are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by the ſecret Almoner, as they call him, who hath no limits ſet him what to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow.</p>
                        <p>The Pope is imitated by the ſacred Senate or Colledge of Cardinals, as in all other ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo eſpeciaily in their liberality to the poor: To inſtance in every particular Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal

                        <p>THere is nothing more for the benefit of poor people, than, when their neceſſity requires it, to lend them money upon their pawns, without exacting any uſe for it. In the time of Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, there was a place appointed for the receiving of the pawns of poor people, and they called it the <hi>Mount</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and of Pawns. It grew much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt by the liberalities and priviledges in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged unto it by the ſame <hi>Paul;</hi> and other Popes of <hi>Rome,</hi> even unto this day.</p>
                        <p>Here are received the pawns of all poor and indigent people whatſoever, and no, or, at leaſt, no conſiderable uſe paid for the money given out upon them. The time alotted for
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63921:30"/>
redemption is eighteen months: if the pawns are not redeemed in that time, they are ſold at an outcry; and the ſumme regiſtred for how much, it it exceed the money given out upon them; the overplus is reſtored to the owners, whenſoever they ſhall call for it, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is their calling for it limited to any time.</p>
                        <p>There are great ſtore of Officers that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to this place, all which, have their month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salaries paid to them for their labour out of the Treaſury of the houſe.</p>
                        <p>It is governed by very able and ſufficient men, both <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens and Courtiers, that make up a Sodality. Who take exact accounts of all the incomes, that no fraud be uſed by any inferiour officer.</p>
                        <p>The work is indeed a peice of very great Charity, and extreamly beneficial to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of people; for all ſuch flock thither, not onely of the City, but of the Villages, Farms and Towns all round about, to whom it is very gainful to take up monies upon their pawns before harveſt, and then having done their harveſt, and made money thereof, to redeem them again.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of viſiting the Priſons, and releiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poor Priſoners.</head>
                        <p>SInce in a great confluence of people of divers Nations ſome outrages will ſtill happen; for repreſſing of them, there are in <hi>Rome</hi> many publick Priſons, and Judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to give ſentence of puniſhment upon the guilty. The Judges are the Pope's Vicar, the Chamberlain, the Governor of the City, the Auditor of the Chamber, the Senator of the people, and many others: And whereas Judges exerciſe judgment many times not in their own perſons, but by Deputies; it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens ſometimes that the priſoners are deferred; and ſo lye longer in fetters than perhaps their cauſe requires.</p>
                        <p>Now to prevent this miſchief there are Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors appointed every month to viſit the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and whom they find there deteined ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for crimes or for debt, and judge injured, they take care to have diſmiſſed, or to releaſe the puniſhment inflicted, or to moderate it.</p>
                        <p>It belongs to that Sodality for charity late mentioned, tho they be liberal to the poor alſo, yet principally to intend this; that by all means they may afford what help they can to the impriſoned. And therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63921:31"/>
ſome Prelate; whoſe office it is to be preſent with the Chamberlains at the viſitation of the priſons, and to aſſiſt the guilty in their cauſe to the utmoſt. And to do it the better, there are adjoined to him, with an honorable Salary, two Proctors; who, ſeeing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the Proceſs of the Guilty, endeavour to defend them what they can, both by words and writing.</p>
                        <p>The poor priſoners have much need of theſe. For tho the Apoſtolick Chamber hath allowed them an Advocate and a Proctor for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; yet ſo great is the number of the cauſes, that oft times theſe are not ſufficient.</p>
                        <p>This Sodality likewiſe, beſides this diligent defence of the guilty priſoners, do thrice every week furniſh bread to thoſe among them that need it; and to the ſick ſend a Phyſitian, and very largely provide Phyſick, and all other things neceſſary for their recovery.</p>
                        <p>In the foregoing Chapter we told you that this Sodality did maintain a Convent of Prieſts at St. <hi>Hierome</hi>'s: out of this Convent they order ſome to go every day, and ſay Maſs to the Priſoners, that they may not want that comfort.</p>
                        <p>Beſides this extraordinary charity towards the priſoners, which is practiſed by this So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dality; There are alſo in <hi>Rome</hi> many other perſons, which go from door to door begging bread and money for them; among whom are thoſe religious men of the <hi>Society of Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Again, that other Sodality of the <hi>Florentines,</hi>
                           <pb n="43" facs="tcp:63921:31"/>
called the <hi>Sodality of Mercy,</hi> upon certain feſtival days in the year make great Dinners for the priſoners.</p>
                        <p>Again, the Preachers often ſtir up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to give more liberally by telling them, that the money gathered is for the priſoners.</p>
                        <p>By all which good offices ſome ſuccour is afforded to that moſt miſerable ſtate of men; and the puniſhment of ſuch wretches is not quite taken off; yet at leaſt in a great meaſure eaſed.</p>
                        <p>There is yet another pious Sodality in <hi>Rome,</hi> for the benefit of poor priſoners, in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of St. <hi>John de Pinea,</hi> near the <hi>Minerva,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>Roman</hi> Citizens and Officers of the Court, much honoured by the munificence of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth.</p>
                        <p>This Sodality every Monday ſends certain Viſitors into all the priſons, to take the names, the Country, the Cauſe, the Judge, and the Notary of thoſe that are newly committed; and with great charity and diligence ſollicite the Judge and Notary, that each ones cauſe may be brought to ſpeedy trial.</p>
                        <p>It is a cuſtome likewiſe of this Sodality twice every year, (That is upon the Feaſt of the <hi>Nativity,</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord,) for all the priſoners of debt under a hundred Crowns, freely to pay their Creditors what each one oweth; and delivering them out of priſon, to give every one a Crown in their purſe, and to ſend them home to their own houſes.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the plentiful proviſion of Dowries for poor Maids.</head>
                        <p>IN this charitable work, as in all other, it will be evident, that the common-Parent, <hi>Rome,</hi> excells all other Cities of the world, by that very great number of <hi>Dowries</hi> which are there yearly beſtowed. Nor is it eaſy to ſet down the certain number of them: For altho the Dowries, ariſing out of certain pious Legacies, be conſtant and uniform, and the account of them eaſily caſt up; yet beſides theſe there are innumerable other Dowries given by certain Sodalities. Who, becauſe they intend not this kind of charity only, but other ſorts alſo, do therefore ſet aſide for Dowries proportionably to the ſtock of their yearly Revenues. So that if they have laid out more in other good works, the leſs remains to be given in Dowries, and if but little in others, almoſt all is diſtributed in theſe. And again, becauſe thoſe particular Dowries, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially which ariſe out of legacies, come not always to publick notice: I muſt content my ſelf to ſpeak of thoſe onely, which I my ſelf have come to know.</p>
                        <p>Upon <hi>New-years day,</hi> then, that <hi>Society</hi> of the <hi>Holy Name</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> founded in the Church
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63921:32"/>
of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Supra Minervam</hi> diſtributes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Dowries to young Maidens.</p>
                        <p>On the ſeventh of <hi>January,</hi> the <hi>Sodality</hi> of <hi>Inholders</hi> give more Dowries.</p>
                        <p>On the fourteenth of <hi>January,</hi> there is a Legacy to that purpoſe of St. <hi>Hillary</hi>'s Chappel in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church.</p>
                        <p>And on the ſame day, the <hi>Sodality</hi> of St. <hi>Julian</hi> of the <hi>Flemmings,</hi> give Dowries to the Maids of their Country.</p>
                        <p>On the ſecond of <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Sodality</hi> of the moſt <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, in <hi>Via lata</hi> give their Dowries.</p>
                        <p>On the ninth, the <hi>Sodality</hi> of St. <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia</hi> give theirs in the Church of the <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On the twenty fifth of <hi>March,</hi> the Sodality of the <hi>Annunciation Supra Minervam</hi> exceed herein all the reſt, giving Dowries every year that day to above two hundred young Maids. And I ſuppoſe this Sodality gave the firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this good work: Wherein they were much helped by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth; and likewiſe Pope <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſeventh left them his ſole heirs.</p>
                        <p>The Dowries, that this Sodality furniſheth, are diſtributed to theſe young Maids (every one led up between two noble Matrons cloathed in white, and with their heads veiled) by the Pope himſelf; who with his own hands de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers to each one a Purſe, with a Bill in it for the receiving of ſo much money; and this he doth publickly at the time of high Maſs.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:63921:33"/>Upon the twenty fifth of <hi>March,</hi> other Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are given by the <hi>Sodality</hi> of <hi>Cooks, Panter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> and <hi>Paſterers,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Vincent</hi> and <hi>Anaſtaſius.</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>To all theſe may be added, ſuch Dowries as accrue upon particular legacies, whereof the number is very great; and alſo which are given by other Sodalities, and eſpecially Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ones, not upon ſet days <hi>Anniverſarily,</hi> but as the neceſſity of times and perſons may require; All which, if they ſhould be caſt up, would amount to a yearly ſumme of monies, almoſt incredibly great.</p>
                        <p>This is to be noted, that all the Dowries given at ſeveral times are not equal, but ſome more, ſome leſs; for one Sodality gives thirty Crowns, another forty, another fifty, to be diſtributed to that end. That of the <hi>Annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation</hi> of the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> gives eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, and beſides to every one a Robe, and a pair of Chopines.</p>
                        <p>For beſtowing theſe <hi>Dowries,</hi> this is the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63921:34"/>
order. A <hi>Petition</hi> is put up to the Sodality, in the name of the Virgin that is marriage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, expreſſing her condition, age, and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Then there are deputed out of the Seniors of the Sodality certain <hi>Viſitors;</hi> who go all together to ſee the ſeveral petitioners and their lodgings: and if they find them of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt report among their neighbours, and have a good teſtimony from their pariſh Prieſt; they make relation thereof to the Sodality: And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly are they written down among thoſe that are to receive Dowries. If they find it otherwiſe, they make no relation at all. Thoſe that are writ down are certified of it; that if they happen to contract themſelves in the mean time, they may ingage for ſo much more to be added to what was promiſed in Dowry. But if any one of thoſe that are written down, and ſo appointed to receive a Dowry, behave herſelf leſs decently than becomes a Virgin, they preſently ſend her word that ſhe hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited that favour; and herein are the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions very rigorouſly obſerved.</p>
                        <p>Now becauſe one of the forementioned Dowries is too little to put off the Maid with; therefore one and the ſame perſon may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted at ſeveral times to receive many Dow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries given by divers Sodalities. So that ſome come to receive at laſt no leſs than four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or five hundred Crowns before ever ſhe be given in marriage.</p>
                        <p>Juſt now while I write this I am told, that a certain pious and rich man is lately dead,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63921:35"/>
who hath left by Will a certain in ſome of money, yearly payable, to make up a handſome Dowry for ſuch women of the common Stews that ſhall be willing to be married. A work well thought upon, and which will not want cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a reward ſutable to its Charity, from him who leaves nothing unrecompenſed.</p>

                        <p>
                           <pb n="51" facs="tcp:63921:35"/>The firſt and chiefeſt of all theſe publick houſes, wherein Strangers of all ſorts, come when they will, are curteouſly and with all kind of Civility entertained, is; That which they call the Hoſpital of the moſt <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> near to <hi>Xiſtus</hi> his bridge.</p>
                        <p>This Hoſpital had its beginning under Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third, very mean, (as moſt other pious inventions) being firſt ſet on foot by <hi>Creſcentius Sylva</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Siena.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This holy Prieſt obſerving many ſtrangers uncertainly wandring about the City, hired, with the help of ſome of his friends, to whom he communicated his purpoſe, a large houſe and fitted it with beds, and there lodged as many of thoſe ſtrangers as the largeneſs of the houſe and the number of the beds could well receive.</p>
                        <p>So charitable a deſign wanted not aſſiſtance: So that in a ſhort time he had built there a fair Church, and purchaſing more houſes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts added, them to the Hoſpital, and Prieſts for divine ſervice to the Church.</p>
                        <p>This Hoſpital, or Houſe of publick recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is governed by a company or <hi>Sodality</hi> of Lay-men (that is a lay charge) tho they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Clery-men too, which Sodality takes care for all things neceſſary. And tho there at any time is uſed Hoſpitality after a moſt curteous manner; yet in the year of <hi>Jubile,</hi> (by reaſon of the extraordinary multitudes of Strangers then flocking to <hi>Rome</hi>) this inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in its greateſt luſtre. For ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63921:36"/>
in one night there are counted no leſs than fifteen thouſand Gueſts. Indeed ſo great a multitude of men cannot be received in the proper lodgings of the houſe onely, tho very capacious; and therefore others adjoining are always hired for the year of Jubile. And as this, and the other expences put them much in debt, then; ſo are they freed from that debt again in the other years wherein the layings out are not ſo exceſſive.</p>
                        <p>The year of Jubile 1600. being ended, and an account taken of the number of Strangers here in the compaſs of that year entertained and booked, they were found to be of men four hundred forty four thouſand five hundred: and of women twenty five thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                        <p>The order uſed in the practice of this chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is admirable. As ſoon as the Strangers are arrived, they all have the firſt night their feet waſhed, and are refreſhed, the women apart by themſelves from the men. After thus waſhing in the Holy year a Sermon is made to them, and then they are conducted to the table; their meat being ſerved-up, as alſo their feet waſhed, this firſt night, uſually by honourable perſons.</p>
                        <p>The Supper ended, they are conducted to Bed; ſo without all noiſe, that it may ſeem a kind of miracle that ſo many men of ſeveral nations accord ſo quietly together.</p>
                        <p>The time of their entertainment here is but for three days; tho it be extended further to thoſe who come from far.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="53" facs="tcp:63921:36"/>To this pious work, becauſe the Revenues of the houſe are not able to bear ſo great a charge, many and large charitable contributions are ſupplyed by others. This is certain and to be admired, that by the providence of God there was never yet wanting to furniſh the table in a handſome manner. For ſuch Strangers as are Prieſts, tho the diet allowed them be the ſame with the reſt; yet in reverence to their order, they have a proper houſe apart deſtined to that uſe.</p>
                        <p>About the year of our Lord 1460. by the confraternity of St. <hi>Lucy</hi> (between the <hi>Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol</hi> and <hi>Marcellus</hi>'s Baths) and becauſe it hath not a Church commodiouſly adjoining, there is hired by the Sodality, till they can build one of their own, another large houſe wherein all the poor Prieſt may be entertained for a whole months ſpace, or longer if need be. And this houſe, that it may be publickly known, wears this title in the front:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>Hospitium Pauperum Sacerdotum Peregrinorum.</p>
                           <p>An Houſe of Entertainment for ſuch poor Prieſts as are Pilgrims, or Strangers.</p>
                        </q>
                        <p>Like to this houſe there is another of later times, erected by <hi>Don John Baptiſta Vives a Spaniard;</hi> who buying a fair Palace ſtanding at the foot of <hi>Collis Hortulorum</hi> in <hi>Rome,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned it for ſuch Strangers, Prieſts; ſuch as are of thoſe nations, who have no particular Colledge of their own in that City, and for the propagation of the Faith; as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Some of theſe Prieſts make no ſcruple voluntarily to offer themſelves to be ſent even into the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Hereticks, or Infidels; either by preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and good example of life to recover them from their errors; or even by effuſion of their own blood to aſſert the Catholick verity.</p>

                        <p>The firſt of theſe in honour to be named is that of the <hi>Germans</hi> dedicated to the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> under the title <hi>de Animâ,</hi> or <hi>of the Soul.</hi> It had its beginning <hi>An.

                        <p>Over it is ſet a congregation of twelve or fourteen men of the ſame Nation, by whoſe pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and authority it is menaged and laid out in pious uſes; eſpecially in Hoſpitality to poor <hi>German</hi> Pilgrims, at what time ſoever they come.</p>
                        <p>For to ſuch there is provided for many days convenient dyet, and lodging. When they depart the town a peice of money do correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the quality of the perſon is beſtowed on them for their voyage. The women have a

                        </p>
                        <p>To the Church for divine offices celebrated after a collegiate manner, belong fourteen Prieſts, a Sacriſt, an Organiſt, four Acolytes. Out of theſe Prieſts, who are ſtiled the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, is choſen one to have a care of the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and to order them, and therefore is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their father: And whereas by a late Rule ſolemn High Maſs is to be ſaid early in the Morning, he is not to diſmiſs them until they have heard it.</p>
                        <p>There is an houſe of Hoſpitality alſo for the <hi>French,</hi> dedicated to St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> with a fair Church adjoining. It is governed by a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of thirty perſons, twelve <hi>Frenchmen,</hi> ſix <hi>Lorainers,</hi> ſix <hi>Savoyards,</hi> and ſix <hi>Britons;</hi> and when any one of them dieth, the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation chooſeth another in his room.</p>

                        <p>That Hoſpitality is ordered by three of the ſaid Prieſts; whereof one is always the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer, and the other two his Aſſiſtants by turns. All Strangers of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, that come, are received here for three days, and then are diſmiſſed with ſome gratuity given them, as a pious and charitable Token.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The Houſe for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> was begun <hi>An. Dom.</hi> 1398. by <hi>John Shepard</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi>-man, and then Inhabitant of <hi>Rome</hi> (upon a ſad accident happening upon an <hi>Engliſh</hi> woman ſtraying up and down the City by night) augmented after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by others, who built alſo cloſe by it a Church, dedicated to the moſt <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi> And near about the ſame time a certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant built a Church to the honour of St. <hi>Edmond</hi> King of that Nation (Whoſe Feaſt is kept the twentieth of <hi>November</hi>) and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to it a little Hoſpital for <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the Region beyond <hi>Tyber,</hi> near St. <hi>Chryſogonus.</hi> In both theſe places was Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality practiſed, till the defection of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After which <hi>Engliſh</hi>-men coming very ſeldome to <hi>Rome, Gregory</hi> the thirteenth (being Pope) added to that houſe of Entertaintment a Colledge for that Nation, and adjoined moreover the foreſaid Hoſpital for Mariners, but not yet taking away the former cuſtome of Entertainment.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Scots</hi> had in <hi>Rome</hi> their houſe of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in <hi>Campo Martio;</hi> and near it a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel dedicated to St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> the Patron of that Kingdome; but when it fell off from the Church, there was none left either to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63921:39"/>
or to receive Hoſpitality. Some years after <hi>Alexander Seaton,</hi> a Nobleman of <hi>Scotland,</hi> yeilded up, in the name of his Nation, that Houſe and Chappel to the <hi>Sodality</hi> of <hi>Corpus Chriſti,</hi> of the Parochial Church of St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> near adjoining; upon this condition; That the Sodality ſhould be obliged to receive and entertain poor Strangers of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation; which it willingly undertook, and bound it ſelf by publick Inſtruments drawn to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and is ready to perform the promiſe when any one come to receive the benefit.</p>
                        <p>An houſe of reception was aſſigned for the <hi>Indians,</hi> near St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Church in the <hi>Vati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> by Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh. What is neceſſary for their entertainment being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to that houſe out of the Apoſtolical Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace it ſelf, it being thought a very unworthy thing that any kindneſs ſhould be wanting to a Nation that came to <hi>Rome</hi> for <hi>Devotion</hi> ſake, from a Country ſo exceeding far off. And by reaſon of that great diſtance there is no time preſcribed them for to ſtay, but if they will always abide here, they ſhall be always maintained, where they are with all diligence taught the Catholick Faith, that if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to their freinds, they may diſcover to them too, how they are deceived.</p>
                        <p>Much what in the ſame manner are the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menians</hi> treated; who after three days Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment are asked for their <hi>Teſtimonials,</hi> which being produced, if they are found to be of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Schiſme, they are adviſed to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63921:39"/>
forſake their Error, and are taught the <hi>Latine Rites</hi> and Religion, that if they ſhould return again to their freinds they may profeſs and defend it.</p>
                        <p>There is alſo near to the <hi>Porta Pia,</hi> founded by Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, an houſe for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and entertainment of Hermits.</p>
                        <p>Moſt of theſe houſes of Charity formentioned have a Church alſo adjoining to them, and divine offices adminiſtred there by a certain number of Prieſts. The care of the Hoſpital and Church is undertaken by a congregation of Lay perſons, of the chief of the ſaid Nations, electing others when any dies.

                        <p>IT is not to be imagined that <hi>Rome,</hi> the great advancer of <hi>Piety,</hi> while ſhe releives Living by ſo many inventions, like a careful Mother, ſhould leave the Dead without all obſequies. The Sodality of Piety did firſt
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63921:40"/>
take care to bury in holy ground ſuch dead bodies as they found throughout the ſtreets and paſſages of <hi>Rome,</hi> or could recover when drowned in <hi>Tyber.</hi> But becauſe, as we have ſeen, they came to be wholly imployed in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works of Charity, There was erected another Sodality of good people, who were wholly to intend their office, and no other: and for ſuch poor as dying left not wherewith they might be decently and chriſtianly buried, they were to take care to have ſuch bodies carried to their graves with all juſt rites, with a convenient number of torches, and Prieſts, and brethren of the Sodality accompanying them, even when they were to be brought from any of the Suburbs or fartheſt part of the liberty of the City, or out of the fields, and Country not a little way diſtant: neither could the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rains, nor the Summer heats any way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard them in ſo holy a cuſtome, ſo that there was ſtill found in this City more than one good <hi>Tobias.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Add we unto this peice of Charity another of the <hi>Florentines,</hi> or rather of the whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Tuſcany,</hi> which is a work admirable for its extraordinary benignity towards ſuch as are condemned to dye.

The Brethren of the <hi>Sodality</hi> begin with gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle words to perſwade the miſerable Creature, yea they take him up lovingly in their arms, and embracing him exhort him to patience according to the condition of the party: and with many arguments drawn out of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Chriſtian Religion; As that God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for his ſake became man, and endured all the miſeries of humane nature, and tho he had committed no offence, yet refuſed not to ſuffer death upon the Croſs; That he was guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of many and indeed very greivous crimes, ſuch as often deſerved death before God, and therefore that he came now to bear the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to ſo many heinous offences: and ſo they go on ſuggeſting theſe and ſuch other things whereby deſperate and exulcerated minds are brought to a ſounder temper, till at laſt he come to confeſs his faults, and, being truly contrite, be reconciled to God.</p>
                        <p>All that whole time, both of the day and night, is ſpent in divine exhortations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes

till the hour of execution come; which when it begins to draw near, Maſs is ſaid; and the perſon to be put to death receives the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, wherewith being fortified, he is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently led forth towards the place of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the Sodality going by two and two before the man that is to dye, (being all covered over head and all down to the very feet with black veſtments, or frocks of Buckram, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a black Croſs) continue reciting Prayers. Thoſe two, that ſpent the night before with him in calming his mind, take him now in the middle between them, and ſo ſupporting him with their ſhoulders and arms lead him through that part of the City which he is to paſs.

                        <p>Children are here taught, almoſt from their very Infancy, the miſteries of the Chriſtian and Catholick Faith, in every Pariſh upon Holy days, with very great care.

                        <p>Now this work is performed, not ſo much
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63921:42"/>
by the Rectors themſelves of every Church, as by the Colledge of Prieſts, erected particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly for that puroſe; to whom is adjoined a Sodality of Lay perſons, who being diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted according to pariſhes contribute their help to aſſiſt the Prieſts. And tho Children may be initiated in the miſteries of faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being taught to read, if they have good memories, and retain what they learn; yet we find it eaſier to deal with thoſe who can read. Wherefore throughout all the regions of the City there are publick Schools erected, whoſe maſters have their Salaries allowed out of the publick. And not many years ſince, certain men out of great charity towards poor Boys took this burthen upon themſelves, to whom afterwards <hi>Clicerius Landrianus,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Lombardy,</hi> and <hi>Commendator</hi> of the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of St. <hi>Anthony</hi> in <hi>Placentia,</hi> made no ſmall addition: and at length by the Popes appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Church of St. <hi>Pantaleon,</hi> near to the Street of the place <hi>Navona,</hi> in the middle of the City, was aſſigned to that charitable Colledge of thoſe men foreſpoken of; and houſes thereabouts provided, ſufficient to receive above twelve hundred poor Boys.</p>
                        <p>Hither then, from all parts, come every day forenoon, and afternoon, tle Boys of the town of what condtion ſoever they be, to be taught: And being diſtributed to ſeveral Claſſes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care is had of them. Here they are taught the firſt Rudiments both of Learning and Chriſtian Religion, and leaſt when they
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63921:42"/>
are diſmiſſed from School, they ſhould run playing about the town, the ſame men that have care of them, conduct them all along in troops by two and two to their houſes until they ſee every one at home.</p>
                        <p>This work ſeems very pious, were it but for this, That thoſe men that undertake it are very far from all ambition, or pride of Spirit, for they deal not but with Children, and theſe of the meaner ſort too: and this alſo not to teach them the Sciences, but with a great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of themſelves, and ſhunning often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to know their letters and to read, and ſuch inferiour Documents.</p>

                        <p>A convenient yearly Revenue to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was aſſigned them by that moſt Holy Pope.</p>

The maintenance, for them
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63921:44"/>
and their Rector, is by a competent yearly Revenue taken out of the Eccleſiaſtical income of the City of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Seminary is governed by the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> with exact care taken of the young men.</p>
                           <p>Beſides theſe <hi>Alumni,</hi> who live upon the publick charge, there are in this Seminary alſo Gentlemens Sons, called <hi>Convictors,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them from thoſe <hi>Alumni:</hi> Theſe pay ſo much a Month more than what is allowed for any one of the <hi>Alumni,</hi> whom they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed likewiſe in number; for hither come to be brought up in Learning not only the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of all <hi>Italy,</hi> and many too from the other ſide of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and beyond the Seas.</p>
                           <p>The manner of Education and breeding of young men here is admirable; for they are trained up to Piety as well as Learning. They go to hear their Lecture to the <hi>Roman</hi> Colledge and every Claſſis of them; hath one of the Fathers of the Society that calls them to Repetition of thoſe things that they heard from their Readers.</p>
                           <p>Every particular Chamber hath one of the ſame Society for a <hi>Prefect,</hi> which is never out of the company of the young men of that Chamber, but is always with them whilſt they dine and ſupp, and walk; and when they go to the Colledge, and when they return.</p>
                           <p>Their Diet is plentiful, and yet frugal. After this ſame manner live all the other Colledges

                           <p>Pope <hi>Julius</hi> the third founded a Colledge in this City for the <hi>German</hi> Nation. For whilſt <hi>Luther</hi> raged ſo in <hi>Germany,</hi> he thought by the means of the <hi>Alumni</hi> maintained in this Colledge, who after ſome time ſpent in <hi>Rome</hi> were to return again to their own Country, their ſeduced Countrymen might be reclaimed to a better underſtanding. Neither was his hope altogether fruſtrate, but yet he dying, this Colledge, which was ſcarce ſupported by a competent yearly Revenue, began to decay, ſo that it was almoſt reduced to nothing. Whereupon <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth, for the great zeal he had for the houſe of God, much approved the deſign of this Colledge, and even founded it again by ſetling on it a very ample yearly Revenue.</p>
                           <p>The Government hereof, as of all the other Colledges founded by that Pope, is committed to the Religious of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and he would have it called the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Colledge, becauſe in it are maintained both <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Hungarians,</hi> and ſome <hi>Flemings.</hi>

There are among them ſome young men of the chiefeſt Gentry in their own Country, who having finiſhed their Studies return home, and do excellent ſervice for the Catholick Faith.

                           <p>This Colledge was founded and built by <hi>Antonio Maria</hi> Cardinal <hi>Salviato,</hi> to which, by particular conceſſion of the Pope, was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted the pariſh Church of St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiro,</hi> whoſe title when the foreſaid Cardinal had obtained, there was then Rector of that pariſh Church a good pious man, who had been bereft of his Parents in his Childhood:
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63921:48"/>
and ſo, having had experience what a miſerable and deſolate condition of life that is, earneſtly be ſought the Cardinal that he would repair that antient Church then falling to decay, and think of relieving poor Orphans.</p>
                           <p>The Cardinal took the Church quite down, and in its place built up another from the foundation, adding to it an Hoſpital, and a Colledge, to which he preſently aſſigned ten thouſand gold Crowns; and afterwards by Will left to it a Farm of the value in thoſe days of twenty thouſand gold Crowns.</p>
                           <p>Altho the Colledge and the Hoſpital be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained both within one Circuit, yet they have no Entercourſe one with another, but each hath its own Rectors and Offices.</p>
                           <p>The Colledge hath no determinate number of <hi>Alumni,</hi> but it is ſtill filled up out of the Hoſpital, by ſuch youths as are found there of better diſpoſition and wit, and of theſe many are afterwards preferred to Prelates, Noblemen, yea to Cardinals themſelves to be their Chaplains, or Secretaries, or Aſſiſtants in their Studies, in all which offices they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably ſhow of what importance it is to have a good education.</p>

                           <p>For theſe there is appointed a place at the foot of the Capitol, and a Church there dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to St. <hi>John Baptiſt.</hi> The houſe is very large, and in it are received in ſeveral quarters ſuch men and women who are come over hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily to the Service of the true God.</p>

                        <p>ALtho, in the <hi>Advent</hi> before the <hi>Nativity</hi> of Chriſt our Lord, and in that antient time of faſting in the Church of God, the <hi>Lent</hi> before his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead, Sermons are moſt frequent, the word of God being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63921:50"/>
then preached every day in moſt Convents, Collegiate and Patriarchal Churches, at which times come abroad great and learned Orators moſt powerful in preaching; yet for the reſt of the year the Pulpits are not ſilent, for on every Feſtival there are Sermons at the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustines,</hi> at the <hi>Dominicans, Servites, Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, Jeſuites,</hi> and other <hi>Mendicants</hi> in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings after Maſs, and in the Afternoons after Veſpers: and the ſame is done likewiſe in many Colledges of Secular Prieſts, which occaſions a very great increaſe of ſpiritual improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>There is in <hi>Rome</hi> a congregation of pious men, termed from their praying <hi>Oratorians,</hi> whoſe Founder was Biſhop <hi>Philip Neri,</hi> now regiſtred in the Catalogue of Saints by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth: To theſe <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth aſſigned a little Church called St. <hi>Maries</hi> in <hi>Vallicella,</hi> which being pulled down was built again into a larger and ſtatelier Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, for the moſt part by the <hi>Caeſii,</hi> as we ſhall declare anon. The Inſtitute of this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to meet every day at ſet hours to ſpend them in Prayer, both vocal and mental, where are preſent a very great number of Secular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The time of Prayer being ended, there is propoſed by any one of the company ſome ſhort point tending to the edification of their neighbour. From thence one of the Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation takes occaſion to diſcourſe by way of Sermon for half an hour, that done another ſteps up, and doth the like, and after him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63921:51"/>
even to four, ſo that every day at divers times you may have no leſs than four divine diſcourſes or Sermons, all much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing to Chriſtian perfection. Theſe are made in the Church. But beſides theſe there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers twice a week, Mondaies and Fridaies, made in the <hi>Oratory,</hi> different from the former both in argument and deſign. For firſt the Litanies are ſaid, next a Quire of Muſick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of moſt ſweet melody of voices, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable harmony of muſical inſtruments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Praiſes are ſung to God; then follows a Sermon, whereby all that are preſent are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to chaſtiſe themſelves, at which time the lights are removed, and the company, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely men, begin to chaſtiſe their bare backs, ſome with Cords, ſome with other kind of Whips, in good earneſt, during which time the Pſalm, <hi>Miſerere mei Deus,</hi> is recited with a loud voice; which being ended, ſign is given of ceaſing, and every one putting on his Doublet again returns to his place; the lights are brought in, and after moſt ſolemn Muſick all are diſmiſſed.</p>
                        <p>This cuſtome of praying, chaſtiſing, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conferring and ſinging, is uſed in many other confraternities and ſodalities of Lay-men.</p>
                        <p>It is obſerved at St. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> in <hi>Campo Martio</hi> near St. <hi>Silveſters,</hi> on Mondaies, Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daies and Fridaies.</p>
                        <p>On Tueſdaies in the Congregation of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſca</hi> at St. <hi>Blaſes</hi> in Mount <hi>Citerius.</hi>

Beſides in the ſame Colledge there is a congregation of Scholars of the better ſort that frequent that Colledge devoted to the bleſſed <hi>Virgins Annuntiation,</hi> theſe being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as Examples to the reſt.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe, beſides theſe Gentlemen, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Tradeſmen, there is a great mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of common country people that flock to <hi>Rome</hi> from all the places round about ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining, upon all Holidays; therefore the <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites</hi> have a fatherly care of them alſo, and preach to them the word of God, where they ſtand aſſembled in the publick Streets and Market places of the City, thereby working upon them to free them from their natural rudeneſs, and breed in them a deeper ſence of piety and devotion. Wherefore in thoſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the vulgar they uſe ſuch fervour of Spirit, and ſuch incitements to repentance,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63921:52"/>
that you ſhall ſee great companies of them im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Sermon ended following the Preacher into ſome Church, and there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently to confeſs their ſins to a Prieſt ready for that purpoſe, and with due preparation (more than uſually is found in ſuch people) to the great comfort of their Souls to come and receive the Holy Communion, which is there delivered to them in great charity: and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly when they are to depart, to every one is given ſome little preſent as a token of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Charity.</p>
                        <p>For a Cloſe, and as it were a Corolary to this Chapter, we will crown it with the <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute</hi> of the <hi>Sodality</hi> of the <hi>Roſary</hi> of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> which to ſo great benefit of Souls was erected in the Church of St. <hi>Maries Supra Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervam.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Brethren of this Sodality meet ſtill upon the firſt Sunday of every month, and having recited firſt the prayers of the <hi>Roſary</hi> go round the Church with tapers in their hands, as the Orthodox always did, uſing the ſolemn Litanies. That done, one of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious of that Convent makes a learned and devout Sermon to thoſe of the Brother-hood and the reſt of the people there preſent, in the praiſe of the bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> which ended they return to their Prayers and ſo depart.</p>
                        <p>This is done (only the Litany omitted) thrice in every week to the great edification, of the Brethren themſelves; and of all the people. For tho Prayers may be ſaid at home, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63921:52"/>
not ſo well as in the Church, where are ſo many Fathers; and where ſo great a cry, aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented much by a happy conjunction, is ſent up to Almighty God. <q>For thou obtaineſt not thy ſuit ſo eaſily (ſaith St. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) when thou prayeſt alone, as when in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with thy Brethren; for in this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more <hi>viz.</hi> a concord, a conſpiring, an union of love and charity, and above all the interceſſion of the Prieſts; for to this end are the Prieſts ſet over the people: That the peoples ſupplications, which are but weak and faint, climbing about theirs which are ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger may together with them be carried up into Heaven.</q>

before the judgment of all others whatſoever; it often falls out that in this kind we run into many and groſs errors. Many good men have ſet themſelves to prevent theſe Errors; but eſpecially and more accurately thoſe of the Oratory, who, as ſoon as they underſtand any perſons to diſagree, make it their buſineſs to find out the cauſe and the original of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord: which being diſcovered they uſe all their arguments that may exhort, and in a manner compel the diſſenting parties to terms of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                           <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of viſiting ſick and weak perſons, and the adminiſtring of Spiritual Refection to the Devout while they are dying.</head>
                        <p>THE Congregation of the <hi>Cratorians</hi> ſo often mentioned, as they are ſtill in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of all works of Chriſtian Piety: ſo to viſit the ſick and aſſiſt them by all kind of ſervices tho never ſo mean, or, if they find them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly weak, to prepare them to dye well, is one of thoſe employments which they chiefly intend, not only going to the publick Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, but very frequently to private houſes alſo
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63921:54"/>
to ſerve the ſick in what they need, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to comfort them with ſolid and devout diſcourſes.</p>
                        <p>But becauſe this Congregation, looking to many other things alſo, cannot ſolely and wholly apply it ſelf to this, which yet amongſt Chriſtians may deſervedly be accounted the chiefeſt, ſince the ſalvation of Souls, which all Chriſtians ſo greatly value, depends on dying well: <hi>Camillus de Lellis</hi> a Prieſt of the Dioceſs of <hi>Theate</hi> inſtituted a Congregation, whoſe proper office ſhould be to take care for the ſick, and never to leave them until they either grew well, or made a happy end in our Lord.</p>
                        <p>The Brethren of this <hi>Inſtitute</hi> do execute this charge with great care and charity to the utmoſt of their power. For being called to any ſick perſon they go not from him, unleſs it be at ſuch times when they return home to refreſh themſelves at their meals, and then alſo others firſt come in, and ſtay in their place, till the former return again to diſmiſs them.</p>
                        <p>There is a manifold and ſingular good uſe of theſe Brethren for the ſick. For altho the firſt deſign of them was to diſpoſe ſuch as were dying to a vertuous and chriſtian departure, yet their perpetual converſation with ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conduceth very much to their recoveries. For by dayly experience they become skilful, and know better than Phyſitians themſelves when and what and in what quantity meats and drinks are to be given to the ſick, which is none of the leaſt neceſſary <hi>Praecognitums</hi> in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63921:54"/>
the Art of Phyſick. Again they put the weak in mind, that, if God ſhould pleaſe to take them out of this world, they diſpoſe by their laſt Will and Teſtament of their temporal goods according to right and equity; provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways that they think not of leaving them any thing, which to ask they decline, ſo as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, they procure with all diligence that ſuch as are dying be fortified with the moſt Holy Sacraments of the Church.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Brethren have their Convent at St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s, near the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or the Temple built by <hi>Agrippa.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>An <hi>Institute</hi> it is extreamly neceſſary and of great Charity, and now almoſt ſpread over all <hi>Italy.</hi> Thoſe that are profeſſed of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wear on the right ſide of their breaſt a very great Croſs of Cloth of a dusky colour, repreſenting the wood of the Croſs. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it is, they ſay, a certain Viſion which the Founder s Mother had, who being great ſeemed to her ſelf to bring forth a Man child ſo marked, and falling into labour was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered of <hi>Camillus.</hi>

                           <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Touching the indefatigable Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, Penance, and the Euchariſt.</head>
                        <p>NOT only thoſe that are dying are to be exhorted unto penitence, but the well alſo, ſince nothing is more uncertain than the health of the body, which not only dayly, but hourly changes: ſo fickle and unconſtant, that he whom we ſaw but now in great bodily ſtrength, and thought he had an age yet more to live, is inſtantly carryed out to be buryed. This man, while he is fighting, his very Arms betray him, another a Wall falls upon; one tumbling out of his Coach ſends out his Soul away in poſt haſt; another the Phyſitian lays aſleep, and the Medicine which ſhould heal him, kils him. If we conſider it right, there is no path ſo much beaten as that from life to death. Chriſtians therefore ſhould take ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial care to make good that in deed which they profeſs in belief: that is by true contrition of heart to procure the Grace of Almighty God, to whom nothing is more pleaſing, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more acceptable than this.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore the frequent uſe of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance in the City of <hi>Rome</hi> is very admirable.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="91" facs="tcp:63921:55"/>For, beſides that in every pariſh Church the Prieſt by his office is bound to adminiſter that Sacrament to all his Pariſhioners, All <hi>Regular</hi> and <hi>Religious</hi> people alſo practice it dayly in their Convents, as the <hi>Augustines,</hi> the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, Franciſcans, Servites,</hi> and other <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicants:</hi> whoſe Churches we ſee well filled with confeſſional Chairs. But a particular care in this kind is taken by thoſe Prieſts eſpecially, who are of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and thoſe alſo of the <hi>Congregation</hi> of the <hi>Oratory.</hi> For among theſe you may ſee every feſtival day an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people confeſſing their ſins to the Prieſts, and receiving the Holy Communion with great Devotion.</p>
                        <p>Theſe <hi>Sodalities</hi> or Confraternities, which we have ſaid are introduced by the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> the <hi>Oratorians,</hi> or by other <hi>Clerks Regular:</hi> and indeed all other Confraternities of Lay-men whatſoever (of which we ſhall ſpeak in the Third Part) have their principal deſigns; That the Brethren of each reſpectively do at leaſt once every month confeſs their ſins to the Prieſt, and come to the Table of Chriſts moſt holy Body.</p>
                        <p>It is a late invention of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to admit a free and promiſcuous concourſe of all ſorts of people to the receiving of the Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; this they call a <hi>General Communion,</hi> wherein ſuch multitudes have met, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times no leſs than thirty thouſand perſons have been found to have been refreſhed by them with this Spiritual Banquet in one and the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63921:56"/>
ſame day. An <hi>Inſtitute</hi> it is of all others moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, and now ſpread into ſeveral places; for in divers Cities it is practiſed once a month, and may be beneficial in all Churches. And that ſo ſignal a work of Piety may not grow chargeable to any pariſhes, there is a particular Sodality in <hi>Rome</hi> conſiſting of Lay-men, which have care of it; who bountifully ſupply the Wax-candles, and all other coſts and charges. And for Prieſts to receive Confeſſions and give Abſolutions there come together ſome out of all orders, and he that manageth this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs chiefly is one <hi>Peter Garavita,</hi> a profeſt Father, and Prieſt of the <hi>Society</hi> of <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And that you may not imagine, that only Citizens and Inhabitants of <hi>Rome</hi> are invited to ſo an effectual means of Devotion, as are Confeſſion and Communion: for the benefit of Strangers alſo, and ſeveral Nations that live far off, there are eſtabliſhed by the Popes Authority three Colleges of Penitentiaries, reſpectively adjoining to the three Patriarchal Churches in this City, wherein are maintained Prieſts skilled in all languages, and enabled by ſpecial authority from the Pope to abſolve the ſins of ſuch Penitents.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. At St. <hi>John Lateran</hi> theſe <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> are of the order of the <hi>Friers Minors</hi> Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantines of St. <hi>Francis.</hi>

                        <p>NOW we come to ſhew the world the Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Charity uſed in <hi>Rome</hi> toward the deceaſed for freeing from the pains of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory ſuch as are detained therein according to the antient Prayer made for them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the holy Canon of the <hi>Maſs.</hi>

                        <p>This memory of ſuch as ſleep in Chriſt the City of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhows by many arguments that ſhe preſerves.</p>
                        <p>For all thoſe foreſaid Congregations or Sodalities, when any of their Brethren deceaſe, do upon ſet days recite for them the Prayers preſcribed by the Church of God commonly called the <hi>Office for the Dead.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="94" facs="tcp:63921:57"/>And leaſt theſe, which are not Members of any Sodality, ſhould be deſtitute of the ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſuch Prayers: There is eſtabliſhed in <hi>Rome,</hi> ever ſince the year 1582. in the pariſh Church of St. <hi>Blaſe,</hi> in the <hi>Via Julia,</hi> a Soda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Lay perſons, called the Sodality of the <hi>Suffrage.</hi> Becauſe the onely intent of it is to be imployed in the Suffrages for the Dead.</p>
                        <p>In the foreſaid Church are maintained ſeven Prieſts, that every day ſay Maſs for thoſe Souls of the faithful, who dye in the grace of God, but are kept from his preſence in Purgatory till they are purged from ſuch ſpots as they contracted here. The Brethren of that Soda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, tho Lay perſons, do yet every Feſtival recite the foreſaid Pſalter of the Church for the dead; and, during the whole octave of the Commemoration of the dead, do every day ſay ſolemn Litanies, and make Proceſſions from their <hi>Oratory,</hi> to the Church of St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory,</hi> and to other principal Churches in the City.</p>
                        <p>And likewiſe very often in the year do they repeat the prayers of <hi>forty hours;</hi> nor do they omit any thing preſcribed by the Church that may any way ſerve towards the expiation of thoſe Souls.</p>
                        <p>But on the Holy day ſet for the Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Dead, which is next after the Calends of <hi>November,</hi> and ſome days follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, there is a great concourſe of all ſorts of people to the aforeſaid Church of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> where Prayers and Oblations are made for the

                        <p>FIrſt on all the chief Feaſts of the year the Pope is publickly preſent together with the Cardinals at Morning and Evening Prayer; and in the greater Solemnities himſelf ſings Maſs: At which Maſſes there is always a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in Latine, unfolding the Goſpel appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Church for that day.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>Advent</hi> upon every Wedneſday, and in <hi>Lent</hi> upon every Friday, there Preaches before the Pope and Cardinals ſome Religious Perſon, learned and eloquent; who with great Power, and Chriſtian liberty reprehends the vices of the greateſt Prelates, if any ſuch are found faulty.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:63921:58"/>On the day of our Lord's Supper, that is <hi>Maundy-Thurſday,</hi> the Pope with his own hands (following the example of our Saviour) doth publickly waſh the feet of twelve poor men; and after wipe them with a Towel, and then giving them a dinner, in which he himſelf ſerves at the Table, ſuffers them not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part till they have received every one a Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a ſumme of Money.</p>
                        <p>On the Feaſt of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> the Pope with great Devotion carrieth in Proceſſion the Bleſſed Sacrament about a great part of the <hi>Borgo.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>On <hi>Aſh-Wedneſday</hi> he introduceth the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of Stations at St. <hi>Sabinas,</hi> in his own perſon. And in all theſe Solemnities the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals do perpetually accompany him.</p>
                        <p>On the Feaſt of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Nativity</hi> of our Lord, both the Pope and the Cardinals adminiſter with their own hands the Bleſſed Body of our Lord to all of the Court rightly prepared.</p>
                        <p>The Pope alſo and Cardinals do often viſit, as their employments permit, divers Churches of the City?</p>
                        <p>Here alſo we muſt not forget that great order of extraordinary Piety, which Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth inſtituted and tranſmitted to his Succeſſors. For that a holy Guard of men devoutly praying might never ceaſe, no not for the leaſt moment of time in this City of <hi>Rome:</hi> He ordained that Prayers for forty hours continuance ſhould be ſtill obſerved
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63921:59"/>
in a ſucceſſive order throughout all the Churches of the City.</p>
                        <p>This takes its beginning for the firſt forty hours in the Popes own Chappel, then paſſeth into St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s, next into St. <hi>John Lateran</hi>'s, and ſo in order into all the Collegiate Churches of the City. The order and manner of theſe Prayers, is thus.</p>
                        <p>The Bleſſed Sacrament of the Euchariſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with great company of Torches and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, is publickly expoſed over the Altar; immediately one of that College kneels before that Altar, moſt intent to his Prayer for the ſpace of an hour, and that hour ended, another ſucceeds him doing the like, and then another, him; People of all ſorts and condition, during the ſame time, night and day coming in by turns, and making their particular private Prayers there until full forty hours are run out; theſe finiſhed, the devotion is transferred to another College for the ſame time, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to another, until it returns as at firſt to the Popes Chappel again.</p>
                        <p>This Solemnity of the forty hours Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is celebrated in the moſt decent ſacred and ſilent manner as is poſſible.</p>
                        <p>The Popes of <hi>Rome</hi> have alſo this cuſtome, for the averting of Wars between Chriſtian Princes, and upon other grand occaſions, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ſolemn Supplications, Litanies and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, wherein themſelves are aſſiſtant, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on foot a great part of the Town, as from their own Palace unto St. <hi>Mary Major,</hi> or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63921:59"/>
ſome other Church of the City: The whole Body of the Clergy preceding, and ſinging the Litanies with an exceeding great Devotion.</p>
                        <p>The Piety alſo of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> as eminently appears in obſerving Feſtival days, to the honour of God, and alſo his Martyrs and Saints; in which <hi>Rome</hi> far exceeds all other places. There is ſcarce any one in the number of all the Saints that hath not ſome Church, or Chappel dedicated to his name in this City. And upon the <hi>Anniverſary</hi> Feaſt it is adorned with handſome furniture, and viſited in great devotion, by an infinite multitude of people, eſpecially by the chief and noble perſons, men and women, and liberally ſupplyed with gifts and preſents.</p>
                        <p>During the time of <hi>Lent</hi>-Faſt there are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways obſerved in ſome Church or other by the faithful people, certain holy Stations out of antient Tradition; which Stations are held in great veneration, and celebrated by a great concourſe of all ſorts of People in a ſolemn manner.</p>
                        <p>And tho the Worſhip of God be ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in all times, yet the Solemnity of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Churches is ſo great in the year of Jubile; and ſo numerous the devout people that perform it, as will hardly find belief. I my ſelf (ſaith the Author) lately ſaw in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this year of Jubile 1625. more than once above forty thouſand perſons upon one day devoutly going from Church to Church in very great fervour of Spirit, and in comely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63921:60"/>
order: not one diſcompoſed, not one but what appeared with that modeſty which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Chriſtian.</p>
                        <p>There are heard no prophane pratlings among them, no wanton glances caſt to and fro; but every one having God preſent in his mind, and his eyes fixed on the ground he walks upon, either recites his <hi>Roſary,</hi> or directs either mental or vocal Prayers, with great affection to Almighty God. That which I moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, in this matter, was, That all that great multitude conſiſted of the people of <hi>Rome</hi> (for in that beginning of the year Strangers were not yet come thither:) They as it were endeavouring to give good example, and to be Leaders to all others in the paths of Piety.</p>

                        <p>The third Patriarchal Church is that of St. <hi>Maries ad Preſaepe,</hi> which is alſo called <hi>ad Nives,</hi> becauſe, by a miracle of Snow falling there in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> it was built in that place by <hi>John Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricius</hi> by intimation of Pope <hi>Liberius.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all theſe three Churches there is dayly celebrated the Holy office of the Maſs, and the Canonical hours ſung upon Feſtivals with Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick and the Organs, to the praiſe and honour of Almighty God, the Beſtower of all good things.</p>
                        <p>There are alſo in this City twelve more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Collegiate Churches of Secular Prieſts. In all which, or in the moſt part, Praiſes are ſung to God always, night and day, and cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical hours obſerved, with a Quire and Muſick in ſome Feſtivals.</p>
                        <p>There are in <hi>Rome</hi> alſo ſixteen other Churches Collegiate of Secular Preiſts, which are either National Churches, or peculiar to ſome So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalities: Of National Collegiate Churches e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven; of Sodalities five. In all which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved likewiſe and ſung dayly the canonical hours, and at Evening Lauds to the Bleſſed <hi>Virgin;</hi> and on Feſtival days they have their Muſick, and each Church is furniſhed with a ſufficient number of Prieſts.</p>

                           <pb n="102" facs="tcp:63921:61"/>There are alſo in <hi>Rome</hi> eighty eight pariſh Churches, ſome of the Collegiate Churches being alſo Parochial.</p>
                        <p>The Rectors of which are by their office bound to celebrate the Holy Maſs for their Pariſhioners every day, to be ready to baptize ſuch as need it, and to give the Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to all deſiring it. The Canons of the Church having alſo preſcribed to Lay perſons that they at leaſt once in the year, <hi>viz.</hi> at the Feaſt of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do receive the Communion in their own pariſh Church; and whoſoever faileth herein in <hi>Rome</hi> is publickly ſeparated from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the faithful, at the Feſtival of St. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> Whereupon every year a moſt exact account is taken of the number of all the Inhabitants of this City.</p>
                        <p>The Rectors of theſe Pariſhes make up an Univerſity among themſelves, and often meet and have excellent diſcourſes about ſuch things as belong to the care of Souls: and ſometimes they propoſe certain <hi>Theſes</hi> in Theology to be publickly diſputed.</p>
                        <p>To theſe Rectors alſo belongs the care of the Houſe of entertainment for poor Stranger-Prieſts mentioned before, Chapter the tenth.

                        <p>OF Monks in <hi>Italy</hi> there be twelve Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which commonly are called <hi>Gaudentes,</hi> becauſe their Inſtitute permits them to enjoy a yearly Revenue.

                        <p>The Inſtitution of thoſe Societies are various; Some taking the three Vows of 1. <hi>Poverty [i. e.</hi> none having any Propriety, but all their means in common] and 2. <hi>Obedience</hi> to the commands of a Superior [<hi>i. e.</hi> in all things lawful] and 3. of <hi>Chaſtity</hi> or Celibacy.</p>
                        <p>Others living together without taking

ſuch vows, and at liberty to relinquiſh the Society when they pleaſe, only obliged during their ſtay to obey and conform to the orders thereof.

                        <p>The chief ends alſo and deſigns of their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi> are different. Some more dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to retirement, continual Mortifications as to the pleaſures and contents of this life [<hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as health permits it] in ſleep, diet, clothes, bed, lodging, company, diſcourſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> (the way to be weaned from all affection to any thing in this world) accuſtoming themſelves to night-watching, ſolitude, abſtinence from pleaſant meat, or drink, frequent faſting, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, clauſure, not receiving viſits from kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or freinds, hair-cloth, hard lodging, nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row cells, and ſpending moſt of their time ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the publick praiſes of God by night and day in the Quire, or in private Prayer or contemplation in their cells. Others more deſigning an active life, and the abounding in various works of Charity toward their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, whoſe purpoſes and employments are ſuch as theſe. For ſtudying Divinity in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the confutation and converſion of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks. For hearing Confeſſions, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and adminiſtring the Sacraments, being aſſiſtant herein to the Secular Clergy and Pariſh Prieſts, where theſe wanting their help. Or,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63921:62"/>
For aſſiſting the Biſhop alſo in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and being ſent and employed where the neceſſities of his Dioceſs or Province ſeem to require it: taking onely a ſingle vow of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence [i. e. in <hi>licitis</hi>] to him, as the <hi>Oblates</hi> of St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> founded by St. <hi>Carolo Borromeo.</hi> Again; For directing men in making their Spiritual Exerciſes, and in all caſes that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their Conſcience, as to good or evil.

                        <p>Theſe among others are the Deſigns and Work of ſo many Religious Societies. And thus are they diligently labouring, ſome more chiefly in one of theſe employments, ſome in another, as their Founders and Conſtitutions variouſly direct and diſtinguiſh them: which employments are here promiſcuouſly put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and ſet down, becauſe it would be too tedious to diſtribute and apply them to the particular Inſtitutions.</p>
                        <p>And in all theſe Convents and Religious Houſes, the Canonical hours and other Hymns and Lauds are dayly ſung both night and day, unleſs it be among thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly and according to their <hi>Inſtitute</hi> are ſo imployed in ſome other work, that they cannot attend both; ſolemn Maſs alſo cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, and on Feſtivals added the Muſick of the Organ, unleſs it be in the reformed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents; for they neither uſe Organ nor ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63921:63"/>
but recite Lauds and Hymns to God in their Churches, according to the canonical hours, in ſomewhat an higher but uniſon tone. And by theſe we ſee that the City of <hi>Rome</hi> hath ſo many Centinels and Watchmen, that whenſoever our Lord ſhall come, he may not find her ſleeping.</p>
                        <p>Beſides theſe of Men, there are alſo other Religious Houſes of Women: ſome with, and ſome alſo without, clauſure, that the more may be attracted to ſuch an holy and retired life. Theſe alſo are accurate obſervers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline, and moſt conſpicuous for holineſs of life, ſome eating no fleſh at all, and obſerving a perpetual Faſt; and after they have taken the habit, being never ſeen again by any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon living out of the Monaſtery, no not by the neareſt of their kindred; uſing no beds, but inſtead thereof ſacks of Straw or bare Boards; not wearing any linnen. Never quitting their Habit, tho very courſe, day nor night, but in it watching and ſleeping [yet nothing more in theſe mortifications is permitted to be done than what is ordinarily found to conſiſt with health; and a relaxation thereof made in caſe of ſickneſs]. Some of theſe Religious are of Virgins; ſome onely of Non-Virgins. Of the firſt of theſe there are in <hi>Rome</hi> houſes thirty one, and three of the other.</p>
                        <p>One of honeſt Widows, who, deſtitute of any of their kindred with whom they may live, have here a kind of <hi>Aſylum,</hi> and ſafe place of refuge.</p>

                        <p>The third is that famous Nunnery of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in <hi>Viâ latâ,</hi> for Harlots that have left off that miſerable courſe of life, and now are known by the uſual name of <hi>Convertitae.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In all theſe Nunneries, beſides the particular Prayers that are made to God for all Chriſtian people, they ſing likewiſe their continual hours, as they are preſcribed by the Church, night and day, with no leſs devotion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency then is uſed in the Convents of the men.

                           <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the Lay-Sodalities and Confraternities in <hi>Rome:</hi> And of their Oratories.</head>
                        <p>THere is a great number in <hi>Rome</hi> of theſe <hi>Lay-Sodalities,</hi> that profeſs great Piety to God, and Charity to their Neighbour. Confraternities both National, as of <hi>Germans, French, Spaniards, &amp;c:</hi> And of ſeveral Trades or other Profeſſions; As of Taylors, Shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers, Scriveners, Stationers, Cooks, Bakers,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:63921:64"/>
Goldſmiths, Fiſhermen, Painters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which Sodalities may alſo be ranged to heads.</p>
                        <p>The firſt, of ſuch as uſe long veſtments down to their feet, being a kind of Frocks, when they meet together after a Collegiate manner in all publick functions.</p>
                        <p>The other, of thoſe who uſe no Garment, and intend only their charge in a private way.</p>
                        <p>Of the former of theſe Sodalities are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred above forty; and of the later above thirty. [Of all which, as alſo of the Churches where they are founded, and to which they relate the Author gives a particular account.]</p>
                        <p>There are alſo three Sodalities of women exerciſing Charities, like to ſeveral of thoſe of the men forementioned, Part 3. Chap. 3. One Sodality of which alſo takes care of thoſe guilty Women, that for their offences are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death.</p>
                        <p>Now the intent of all theſe Confraternities and Sodalities is, in the general, one and the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> By their Prayers and good works to render Almighty God propitious to the world, and with all readineſs to aſſiſt every one of their Neighbours in their particular neceſſities, as far as they are able.</p>
                        <p>And the Brethren of all theſe <hi>Sodalities</hi> are employed on every Holy-day in certain works of Charity: either in giving Dowries to poor Girls, or diſtributing Alms to the needy: or viſiting the Priſons, with a purſe made up to releive thoſe that lye there for debt, or for other civil cauſes; or to viſit the ſick of their
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63921:65"/>
own Confraternity, or to do the laſt office to their Dead; and to pray for their Souls: And altho every one of the forenamed Sodalities do intereſt themſelves in all theſe good works which I have named, yet do they chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that particular peice of Charity, for the ſake of which they were framed into a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dality; ſo not hindring the offices of others.</p>
                        <p>And very many of theſe Sodalities, beſides their being founded in ſeveral Churches to which they repair, have alſo of their own certain Oratories apart like to Churches, wherein on all Feſtivals they ſing the Canonical hours.</p>

                        <p>THE Pope being in a double capacity; As the common Father or Paſtor of the whole Catholick Church: And as a Prince of that Dominion and Territory, which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſubject unto the Church: and not being able to do every thing by himſelf which belongs to the adminiſtration of either charge, hath many Aſſiſtants in both functions, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Cardinals of the Holy <hi>Roman</hi> Church, whoſe help and counſel he makes uſe of in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers qualities.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="111" facs="tcp:63921:65"/>In the firſt and principal place, by calling together, as it were, a <hi>Senate</hi> of thoſe Fathers, which is termed a Conſiſtory; wherein the Pope layeth open thoſe affairs which are of moſt weight and importance concerning the State both of the univerſal Church, and alſo of his particular Dominion, asking theſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their ſeveral Opinions thereupon, and then deliberating what is fit to be done.</p>
                        <p>And becauſe this Conſiſtory cannot well be aſſembled weekly: and there intervenes many times ſuch buſineſſes as require quicker diſpatch; Therefore there is erected for ſuch matters a certain particular Congregation of Conſcript Fathers, who may meet together oftner, and certify the Pope of what is therein done and decreed; for thoſe Decrees receive their Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution only from him.</p>
                        <p>Other buſineſſes which dayly occur, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not a compleat Senate, are committed to ſeveral Congregations of Cardinals; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed, ſome in the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Diſcipline and whole State of Chriſtian Religion; and ſome in the <hi>civil</hi> adminiſtration of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Dominion.</p>
                        <p>The ſeveral Congregations, ſet over matters of Religion, are ſeven.</p>
                        <p>The Firſt is the Congregation of the <hi>Holy Inquiſition</hi> into Heretical pravity. In this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation are examined and ſifted all perſons oppoſing the Catholick Faith, and thoſe that are found to offend therein puniſhed. The Fathers of this Congregation meet every Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday;
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63921:66"/>
and on Thurſday the next day give an account before the Pope of all the Acts and Deeds done among them in that Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                        <p>The Second Congregation, for matters in Rel gion, is that of the moſt illuſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who are choſen <hi>Interpreters</hi> of the Holy Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> to whom is committed the interpretation of the Sanctions of that Council for the manner of putting them in execution. Into this Congregation are choſen thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are the moſt learned of all, and the <hi>Secretary</hi> to it is always reputed one of great knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The Third Congregation for Religion is that to which is committed the care of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Rites and Ceremonies; who are to correct all offences againſt them, and to oppoſe all Superſtition, or whatever exteriour kind of worſhip that hath not been admitted into the Catholick Church.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth Congregation of Religion is ſet over the affairs of <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Regulars.</hi> Between whom ſince many difficulties do ariſe dayly; and it is not expedient that they ſhould be determined by any ſolemn judicial Act: This Congregation hath power to end or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſuch difficulties yet without any form of Judicature.</p>
                        <p>The Fifth Congregation for Religion takes care of thoſe <hi>Books,</hi> which are dayly ſet forth in print, to reviſe them; and ſuch as they find impious againſt Faith or good Manners, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63921:66"/>
and forbid all Catholicks the reading of them: and to inſert the names of them into the Catalogue of prohibited Books, whence the Congregation is ſtiled The Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Index</hi> or Catalogue.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth Congregation for Religion is that called The Congregation of <hi>Propagating</hi> the <hi>Faith,</hi> of late erected by <hi>Gregory</hi> the fifteenth. The principal intent whereof is to reduce all Hereticks and Schiſmaticks to ſound Doctrine, and a right underſtanding. This Congregation is held twice every month; and once before the Pope himſelf.</p>
                        <p>The ſeventh Congregation of Religion, which hath its name from the <hi>Eccleſiastical immunities,</hi> was inſtituted by Pope <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the eighth. Before theſe are brought all conteſts about Juriſdiction, between the Officers of Kings and Princes, and Biſhops, or other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical perſons; and their chief care is to preſerve the Eccleſiaſtical Liberties free from all temporal burthens and encroachments.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Piety of the Prieſts and People in the dayly Service of God: and of the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary care taken in their Ordination.</head>
                  <p>THE Paſtors of <hi>Paris</hi> are all, generally, known to be men of exemplary lives, and ſound learning, being, the moſt of them, Batchelors, Licentiates, or Doctors of the famous faculty of <hi>Sorbonne.</hi> Theſe calling to mind what St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath taught, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it with a venerable aſtoniſhment, that <hi>every high Prieſt taken from among men is appointed for men, in thoſe things which appertain to God, that he may offer gifts and ſacrifices for ſins, as well for the people as alſo for himſelf,</hi> uſe all care and induſtry to apply the merits and medicinal grace pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by our Lord's painful paſſion to the poor ſinful Souls of their flocks, by deriving into them thoſe fountains of grace which are conferred by their miniſtery in the Sacraments of <hi>Baptiſme, Penance,</hi> the bleſſed <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore alſo beſides themſelves (not ſufficient for the neceſſities of thoſe great multitude of people under their charge,) a great number of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63921:70"/>
other Prieſts, which theſe good Paſtors take into their Societies and Communities (ſome forty or fifty, ſome an hundred, ſome more, ſome fewer, according to the vaſt numbers of their pariſhioners) approach daily to the ſacred Altars from morning till noon with humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and veneration to anſwer their peoples expectations and devotions, who concur with them in a ſweet harmony to offer up their Vows and Prayers. So this true, clean, and unbloody Sacrifice (which the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told) being offered to God in every place, and ſeconded by the ſacrifice of the lips and hearts of the pious people, ſerves for the happy imployment of the whole forenoon. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon wants not its parts neither, which is dayly performed in the evenſong and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſo that the Church doors are rarely ſhut up in <hi>Paris</hi> all the week long. Beſides theſe general pious practices of the people, which they exerciſe every day in the week all <hi>Paris</hi> over, there is ſcarce one day in the year in which there is not ſome particular ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, at one Church or Monaſtery or another, (to which there is great confluence of people, by reaſon of ſome eminent Preacher:) or the expoſing of the <hi>Bleſſed Sacrament,</hi> and pardons to be gained; as it appears by a certain Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manack, made of ſet purpoſe to direct pious people to the ſaid Solemnities.</p>
                  <p>And as there is no day paſſes without publick Service done to God: ſo there is no hour of the day or night in which God's praiſes are
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:63921:70"/>
not ſung in <hi>Paris.</hi> The <hi>Oratorians</hi> begin the divine office at Seven a clock in the evening. At St. <hi>Geneviefues</hi> at Eight. The <hi>Penitents</hi> at Nine. The <hi>Carmelites</hi> at Ten. The <hi>Carthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> at Eleven. St. <hi>Victors,</hi> our <hi>Ladies,</hi> and others till Two. From Two till Four at the <hi>Benedictines, Bernardins,</hi> and divers others. From Four, till Five, Six and Seven; this done at all Collegial and Pariſh Churches. So that what the royal Prophet foretold, is perfectly accompliſhed: <hi>From the riſing of the Sun to the ſeting of the ſame, God's holy name is praiſe worthy, praiſed and magnified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus is Piety practiſed all the working days of the week, all the year long. To which on Holidays is added a Sermon, and upon Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days Holy Bread, Holy Water, the Proceſſion and Prone (that is a familiar explication upon the Goſpel of the day) for the forenoon, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a formal Sermon and Catechiſme for the afternoon: This is the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice all <hi>Paris</hi> over. But the Paſtors zeal for the inſtruction and inflamation of the people's hearts ſtays not here, but further by himſelf, or his order, there are moſt eloquent Sermons made all the days of <hi>Advent</hi> and <hi>Lent</hi> (ſave Saturdays) by the ſame Preachers, who are followed with a wonderful concourſe of Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and a no leſs admirable quiet attention of ſo great a multitude. Can then our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, without affected malice, pretend that the Papiſts are nouſled up in ignorance? which with the proud <hi>Manicheans</hi> they impudently
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63921:71"/>
object againſt them. And as the dignity of Prieſts and height of paſtoral functions is moſt venerable and dreadful; ſo is their care as great, as far as humanly can be deviſed, to make a hopeful proviſion of young Prieſts to aſſiſt them in their life time, and ſo to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in their places after their deaths. And to this effect a Secular Prieſt, and a great ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of God (whoſe admirable works of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity have made him famous all the world over, as here below you ſhall ſee.) <hi>F. Vincent</hi> de <hi>Paul</hi> ſuggeſted an effectual means to the moſt illuſtrious and moſt reverend Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> then being (to wit, above thirty years ago;) who highly approved and confirmed it, and ordered it to be obſerved by all who ſhould pretend for holy orders at his hands: and it is ſtill continued with like approbation, by his command who doth now illuſtrate the ſaid See. <hi>viz.</hi> That all who ſhould take holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſhould be obliged to make a ſpiritual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat at St. <hi>Lazares</hi> (where this Father <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> governed) for the ſpace of ten days; that none ſhould raſhly intrude themſelves into ſo dreadful a Miniſtery. And whereas this is a thing as worthy the approbation as imitation of all Biſhops, it may be of good uſe and edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to put down here the exerciſes in that holy retreat in particular.</p>
                  <p>Ten days then before the Collation of holy orders, all the <hi>Ordinandi</hi> repair to St. <hi>Lazars,</hi> ſometimes fifty or ſixty, ſometimes to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one hundred, where they find bed and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63921:71"/>
board, and all things ready by God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence without their care or coſt; and they are all moſt humanely and charitably received not ſo much into the houſe, as into the boſome, of the pious Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>Two different Entertainments are made to them every day, the one in the morning, upon the chief heads of moral Divinity: the other towards the evening, of the vertues, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities proper to their intended function.</p>
                  <p>There are Ten made in all of either kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Forenoons Entertainment.</hi>

                  <p>The ſeventh, Is an explication of the other ſeven commandments, which concern our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

                  <p>The ninth, Of the Euchariſt as it is a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and of extream Unction and Marriage.</p>
                  <p>The tenth is the explication of the Creed, with what is neceſſary to be known by every Prieſt, and what they may teach the people thereupon with profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Afternoons Entertainment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt day is of mental Prayer. Firſt the motives to it for Clergy-men. Secondly wherein it conſiſts. Thirdly the method and means to perform it. And in this they are exerciſed every day for ſome time.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond day the Speech is of ones Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of the ſtate of a Church-man. That this Vocation ſhould be had before one pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf to <hi>Orders;</hi> wherein it conſiſts, and which are the marks of it, with the means to know it, and to correſpond with it.</p>
                  <p>The third ſpeaks of the ſpirit of a Clergy-man: and ſhews how he is to enter into this ſpirit: wherein it conſiſts: the marks of it, the means to acquire it, and to grow perfect in it.</p>
                  <p>The fourth treats of orders in general: of their inſtitution, neceſſity, matter, form, effects, and differences, with the diſpoſitions neceſſary to receive them.</p>
                  <p>The fifth, Of the firſt Tonſure, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the doctrine of that Ceremony, The obligations contracted by it, The diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and qualities required.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The eighth, Of the office of Deacon, and the vertues proper to it, particularly of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>The ninth, Of Prieſthood, and of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge neceſſary for Prieſts, to acquit themſelves of their duty.</p>
                  <p>In the tenth is a diſcourſe of the life of a Clergy-man, wherein it is made appear, that they who have received holy orders ought to lead a much more holy life than that of Lay-men, with many advices to help towards ſuch a life. All theſe things they repeat in their conferences made afterwards, the better to commit them to memory.</p>
                  <p>They make every day about half an hour of mental Prayer, and conferences upon it after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to inſtruct ſuch as are leſs exerciſed therein, how to uſe conſiderations, to move affections, and to make reſolutions. They are dayly exerciſed in the functions of the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which they are to take, and in the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the holy Maſs. They are made to recite the office altogether, and to obſerve the ſtops <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are diſpoſed to make their general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, at leaſt from their laſt general one;

                  <p>They have ſeven hours to repoſe in by night, and two hours of holy converſation every day, this is after dinner and ſupper. In which time they read the holy Scriptures, and <hi>Molina</hi> of the <hi>dignity and ſanctity of Prieſt-hood.</hi> Upon Sunday, after they have taken orders, they aſſiſt at high Maſs, and communicate in thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for their holy ordination, and ſo return to their own homes.</p>
                  <p>Thus they are moſt ſubſtantially and piouſly prepared; which good diſpoſitions are viſibly obſerved to be followed with ſuch bleſſed ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, that great benedictions of admirable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations in the whole Clergy of <hi>France</hi> are ſeen every where.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Of the beginning and Progreſs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of the Miſſion.</head>
                  <p>IN the year of our Lord 1624, <hi>March</hi> the firſt began the happy eſtabliſhment of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Congregation of the Prieſts of the Miſſions, in the College of <hi>Bons-enfans,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Mr. <hi>Vincent Paul</hi> by the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious <hi>John Francis de Goudy,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> to that purpoſe. <hi>viz.</hi> His Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the General of the <hi>Galeeres,</hi> and his moſt vertuous <hi>Lady</hi> being well acquainted what
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63921:73"/>
great things Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> had performed in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their own Lord-ſhips in that kind for the good of their poor vaſſals and God's glory, had long conceived a pious deſire to concur jointly to be <hi>Founders</hi> of the ſaid Miſſion, which they imparted to their brother the Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, to make uſe of his power over Mr. <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi>'s Spirit (whom they knew to be as ſlow in undertaking, as diligent and faithful in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming what he once undertook) to induce him to accept the charge; which was done accordingly, and he wholly acquieſced to the Arch-biſhops pleaſure. Hereupon were four thouſand Piſtols put down by the moſt noble and pious <hi>Founders</hi> in Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s hands in ready money, upon the following conditions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the end and whole imployment of theſe Miſſionaries ſhould be to ſend to, and to procure the corporal and ſpiritual good of, the poor people of the villages; and that too ſo wholly, that they were not to meddle to preach, or adminiſter Sacraments in any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable towns, ſave in caſe of extream ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, but to go from village to village to inſtruct and aſſiſt thoſe poor abandon'd Souls. Secondly, That they were to renounce all Church benefices, dignities and offices, to apply themſelves intirely and purely (with the leave of the <hi>Ordinaries</hi>) to the ſaving of thoſe poor people, by Sermons, Catechiſms, general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that too at their own coſts and charges, without admitting of any retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution or reward in what kind ſoever. Thirdly,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63921:74"/>
That the Election of proper Subjects ſhould be at Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s pleaſure, who ſhould go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern them all his life long. And that which is worthy of ſpecial obſervation, is; That theſe bleſſed <hi>Founders</hi> ſo purely and diſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſtly aimed at God's glory, and the good of the poor alone; that they made no reſerves of any fixed thing relating to themſelves in particular, either in point of honour or profit. With this vertuous foundation Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to comply, having one only companion in the beginning, which ſoon after increaſed to the number of ten or twelve, and e're this (as we may gueſs with probability) amounts even to thouſands: And from that rich ſourſe whole colonies did ſpread themſelves not only all <hi>France</hi> over, but even extended themſelves to forreign lands. The firſt eſtabliſhment, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from this fountain, was began at <hi>Toul</hi> in the year 1635. by the conſent and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Biſhop of the place. The ſecond at <hi>Richlieu</hi> 1638. founded by the moſt eminent <hi>Cardinal</hi> of the place, with obligation to preach <hi>&amp;c.</hi> according to their pious Inſtitute, to the poor of the Dioceſs of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> as alſo to thoſe of <hi>Lucon,</hi> of which he had formerly been Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. The third was founded by the ſaid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal at <hi>Lucon</hi> it ſelf in the year 1645. with full power granted by the Biſhop thereof to preach and teach <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all over his Dioceſs. The fourth at <hi>Troy,</hi> in the year 1638. by the charitable aſſiſtance of the Biſhop of the place. The fifth in the Dioceſs of <hi>Geneva,</hi> in the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63921:74"/>
year 1640. where the Commander of <hi>Sillory</hi> founded them a Seminary, where they ſtill labour with much fruit; ſtill with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Biſhop of the Dioceſs, which I ſhall not hereafter need to mention. The ſixth in the year 1641. at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Dutcheſs of <hi>Ayguillon,</hi> who alſo founded ſeven of the ſaid Miſſionaries in her Dutchy of <hi>Ayguillon.</hi> The eighth was founded again by the ſaid Dutcheſs at <hi>Marcelles.</hi> The ninth in the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Caors,</hi> in the year 1643. by the Saintly Biſhop thereof. The tenth in the Dioceſs of <hi>Reimes,</hi> by the Arch-Biſhop <hi>Vallancy,</hi> 1644. The eleventh at <hi>Montmir</hi> in <hi>Brye,</hi> by the Duke of <hi>Reti,</hi> in the year 1644. The twelfth at <hi>Zaintes,</hi> by the Biſhop and Clergy the ſame year. The thirteenth at <hi>Mons,</hi> by the Biſhop 1645. The fourteenth in the Dioceſs of St. <hi>Mala,</hi> at St. <hi>Meen,</hi> in the year 1645. The fifteenth at <hi>Genua</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> at the inſtance of Cardinal <hi>Duraſto</hi> Arch-biſhop of the ſame place, in the year 1645. The ſixteenth at <hi>Agen,</hi> by the Biſhop of the place, 1650. The ſeventeenth at <hi>Crecy</hi> in the Dioceſs of <hi>Meaux,</hi> in the year 1641. The eighteenth was founded at <hi>Vaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> in <hi>Polognia,</hi> by the liberality of that moſt pious Queen in the year 1651. The nineteenth in the Dioceſs of <hi>Montauban,</hi> by the Biſhop of the place, in the year 1652. The twentieth at <hi>Tregaier</hi> in <hi>Britaine,</hi> by the Biſhop and Count of the place, in the year 1654. The one and twentieth at <hi>Adge</hi> in <hi>Languedoc,</hi> by the Biſhop and Count of the place, in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63921:75"/>
year 1654. The two and twentieth at <hi>Turin</hi> in <hi>Piedmont,</hi> at the inſtance of Mr. <hi>le Marquis</hi> of <hi>Pianezz,</hi> who founded them 1654. The three and twentieth at <hi>Amiens,</hi> by the Biſhop of the place, with the perpetual direction of his Seminary. The four and twentieth at <hi>Noyon,</hi> by the Biſhop of the place, with the direction of his Seminary. This was reſolved upon in Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s life time, but was only accompliſhed after his death. He ſent alſo Miſſionaries into <hi>Africk,</hi> to <hi>Tunis</hi> and <hi>Algiers,</hi> to aid, inſtruct and comfort the poor Chriſtian ſlaves, who were there, to the number of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or thirty thouſand. To <hi>Madagaſcar,</hi> alſo beyond the line, a voyage of ſix months ſail, to endeavour the converſion of thoſe poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels.

the extream wants and calamities of <hi>Lorain</hi> hapning in thoſe days, procured to be ſent thither at divers times, and cauſed to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed amongſt the moſt needy, to the ſumme of ſixteen hundred thouſand Franks (that is, ſixteen hundred thouſand Piſtols) to which the ſaid Miſſionaries added no leſs large proportion of their ſolicitudes and pains, who ſpent their whole time for many years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in viſiting the poor and the ſick, and in furniſhing many thouſands of them with all things neceſſary for body and Soul.

                  <p>AS Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> and the pious <hi>Pariſian</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies Charities had wrought, and were ſtill working, wonders among the poor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed people abroad: ſo his and their pious care did not the while overlook <hi>Paris,</hi> nor was wanting at home. Here he conſidered the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable condition of ſo many poor abandon'd new-born Infants, whoſe bodies and ſouls are expoſed to utter perdition, either by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural cruelty of naughty women, or by the extream poverty of neceſsitous parents, who covertly leave them in the ſtreets to all adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63921:79"/>
of which kind of deſerted Innocents it is obſerved, in this vaſt world of <hi>Paris,</hi> that ſcarce a year paſſes without three or four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the town and ſuburbs; and ſuch a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nurſery, every one will judge, cannot be maintained with a little. He therefore by their charity procured an <hi>Hospital</hi> to be built in St. <hi>Lazar</hi>'s ſuburbs, for the future recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch children as were found ſo expoſed; the annual maintenance whereof, amounts to no leſs than four thouſand piſtols, which is ſtill growing up to more and more, for <hi>Charitas numquam excidit.</hi> And theſe poor ſouls are till this day nouriſhed and brought up under the care and aſſiſtance of ten or twelve good Siſters of the Charity, with the help of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Nurſes, who live in the ſaid Hoſpital, together with a many more in the Country, who receive a monthly pay. When they are once weaned they are delivered back to the Siſters of the Charity; who in teaching them to ſpeak, teach them alſo to pray, to know God, to love and ſerve him. As they grow up in years they are taught ſome little works to keep them out of idleneſs, till providence ſort them with ſome fit occaſion for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Father alſo by his powerful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations, and for the advancing them in the fear, of God, and of their poor neighbours, as alſo for the more plentiful relief of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous, prevailed with the Princeſſes and Dutcheſſes, and other Ladies of the prime
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63921:79"/>
                     <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the number of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and above, to deveſt themſelves of the rich and ſumptuous robes ſuitable to their illuſtrious conditions, and to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Hoſpitals in the modeſt attire of ſimple gentlewomen, with aprons before them, to ſerve and comfort the moſt deſpicable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures alive; as common Beggars, Porters, and wounded Soldiers, moſt naſty and gaſtly to behold. And this they make their buſineſs, and go ſeriouſly about it, as if it were a thing belonging to them of duty, without diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any niceneſs of or diſdainfulneſs thereat. Nor do they go thither for faſhion ſake, and by way of divertiſement: but as their hearts are full of compaſſion upon the beholding of ſuch ſad ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, ſo are their mouths full of conſolation and inſtruction, and their hands no leſs repleniſhed with charitable preſents agreeable to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of thoſe, otherwiſe contemptible, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (if they did not eye our Saviour Chriſt in them); which relief the poverty of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals could not ordinarily afford to ſo vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Whereas thoſe good Ladies made plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful proviſion thereof in every kind, in a Chamber near adjoining which they hired to that purpoſe. And every day by turns four of them performed that pious miniſtery of going from bed to bed to make the diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with an humble meekneſs well ſuited to ſo Chriſtian a work. By theſe familiar and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing corporal aſſiſtances the good Ladies gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the hearts of thoſe poor people, and in
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63921:80"/>
conſequence their Souls: for it was obſerved, that in the ſpace of one year, they induced ſeven hundred and ſixty of thoſe infirm and maimed perſons to abjure their <hi>Hereſy,</hi> and imbrace the <hi>Catholick Faith.</hi> To ſay nothing of multitudes of others, who were moved by their vertuous examples and wholſome advice to make general confeſſions, and to reſolve of a more Chriſtian life than formerly they had led. Nor did this ſuperlative example of chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity keep within the compaſs of what theſe noble Ladies performed in their own perſons: but as the nature of good is to be communicative, it ſpread it ſelf not only all over <hi>Paris,</hi> but even extended to many remote Villages and Dioceſſes, to the extream ſolace and relief of poor honeſt families, who were as little accuſtomed to beg their bread, as otherwiſe little able to gain it by their daily labours.</p>

                     <p>The bleſſed example of theſe good Ladies ſerved as the <hi>primum mobile</hi> under God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite other Ladies of an inferiour rank, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with many honeſt and vertuous Burgeſſes of the beſt ſort, to emulate them in ſo bleſſed a practice; and it had ſo powerful an influence upon them, that the moſt, or even all, the pariſhes of <hi>Paris</hi> have meetings at leaſt every month (being all aſſociated together in a holy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63921:80"/>
confraternity) to diſcover and confer upon the neceſſities of their reſpective pariſhes at the Curate's houſe, and accordingly, by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections among themſelves, to provide relief for them. The diſtribution of their charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble collections was at firſt performed by the good Ladies own hands, who took the pains to go and viſit the poor and the ſick of the pariſh, and take a more particular aſſurance of each ones neceſſity; but in a ſmall time they were taught by experience, that ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther courſe was to be taken to carry on ſo pious a work effectually: for they found that part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the care of their family could ſcarce diſpenſe with their abſence, partly their husbands had no great ſatisfaction in their converſation with ſuch infirm and naſty poor people; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they ſaw that their ſmall ſtrength and skill in that kind came not home to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the ſick: wherefore they adviſed of ſome better way. And Mr. <hi>Vincent,</hi> who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was at a loſs to invent means to promote charity, found out, and ſetled a conſtant and effectual way to continue the work, and it was this. M. <hi>Le Gras,</hi> ſometime wife to Mr. <hi>Le Gras,</hi> Secretary to Queen <hi>Margaret,</hi> now Widow, whoſe maiden name was <hi>Marilac,</hi> of the family of the moſt vertuous and famous <hi>Chancellor</hi> of that name, who had the moſt eloquent and pious <hi>Camus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bellay</hi> for her ſpiritual Director, till he delivered her up into Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s hands, where ſhe was like to loſe nothing in point of her propenſion
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:63921:81"/>
to ſerve the poor: this vertuous Lady, I ſay, was the perſon pitched upon by her preſent Director, as the prime inſtrument for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſettlement. And certainly divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence was as much in this choice, as her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings were bleſſed with admirable ſucceſs. For ſhe being wholly addicted to the ſervice of the ſick, he trained her up in that way, to fit her for ſome greater work for the future, and made her make her firſt <hi>Eſſaies</hi> in the <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages</hi> of divers Dioceſſes, where there was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe no <hi>Hospitals</hi> to ſuccour the poor and ſick, as in that of <hi>Beavais, Sanlys, Soiſſon, Meaux, Chaalons</hi> and <hi>Charters.</hi> In all which with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible pains, being onely accompanied with ſome other gentlewomen and a Maid, ſhe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Confraternities,</hi> which laſt till this day. But while he and ſhe had no other deſign but this lowly way in the Villages, God had a greater deſign upon them to bring it into the great town of <hi>Paris,</hi> where ſhe is made the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a company of courſe Country Maids, which he deviſed for certain aids to the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Dame of <hi>Paris,</hi> to the effect intimated as above.</p>
                     <p>They are called <hi>Maids,</hi> or Siſters of the <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> and were inſtituted by Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> to ſerve the poor, eſpecially thoſe that are ſick, as he had already inſtituted <hi>Miſſions</hi> of men to preach to the poor. Mrs. <hi>Le Gras</hi> was the woman who was put to inſtruct them in vertue, and to breed them up, and faſhion them to the end for which they are gathered together, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:63921:81"/>
to aſſiſt the Dames of <hi>Paris</hi> to ſerve the ſick in their pariſhes, in the Hoſpitals, or where elſe they may be called. As they are brought up by that good mother in humility, patience, and painful labours, agreeable to their end, ſo they are ſuted to it in their attire; which is, a plain courſe gray coat, without welt or gard, made cloſe to their body, with a cloſe plain kerchief to their head; and their imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to carry the Pottage-pot between two of them, upon a ſtaff all up and down the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh (which they keep as bright as the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander</hi> doth his Andirons); and to diſtribute broth and meat, with other neceſſaries, to the needy according to the exigency of their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wants. This Pot is prepared by turns in the <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> houſe of the Confraternity, who are to afford fire and ſeaſoning, the reſt being ſupplyed by the mutual collections of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.

                  </head>
                  <p>A Good Burgeſs of <hi>Paris</hi> came one day on his own accord to Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi>'s Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, who, as it appears, had learnt the true way of trading for the Kingdome of heaven (for he was not willing that his left hand ſhould know what his right hand did, leaſt vanity ſhould rob him of ſome part of his purchaſe): his money he was moſt willing to give, or even to ſteal it upon him, but he was not willing to lend his name to own the gift, but it was freely given, and upon no other condition or obligation than this, That his ſhould never (be <hi>forgotten</hi> would vanity have indented) be known; and indeed it never was known to this day. And there was it ſeems no leſs care uſed by the Truſtee to conceal the ſumme given, than the name of the pious giver, ſince it is ſhut up in theſe indefinite terms, <hi>a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſumme.</hi> Yet the imployment which the good Steward made of it, will he, nill he, diſcovers it to have been ſo conſiderable, that it muſt needs have paſſed ten thouſand Piſtols. With this ſumme he purchaſed two houſes, a competent garden, and furniſhed it with all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63921:82"/>
neceſſaries, together with an anſwerable live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood for forty perſons: <hi>viz.</hi> Twenty men, and as many women, which were ſtill to be poor old decayed Tradeſmen <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe he diſpoſed of in two different houſes, the women being ſeparated from the men; which yet he contrived ſo ingeniouſly, that one Maſs ſaid in a little Chappel, and one Reader at the Table, ſerved for them both. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted one of his Miſſioners to ſay their Maſs, to inſtruct them, and to adminiſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and ſome of the Siſters of the <hi>Charity</hi> to aſſiſt and ſerve them. This houſe he called the <hi>Hospital</hi> of the name of <hi>Jeſus:</hi> and paſſed a <hi>Declaration</hi> of this foundation before <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> without the name of the <hi>Founder</hi> at all, that a new name may be given him in heaven. And it was approved by my Lord Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> and ratified by the Kings Letters Patents.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of the Charities procured for the poor Criminals condemned to the Gallies.</head>
                  <p>WHile Father <hi>Vincent</hi> was ſetling a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood for theſe poor Artificers, who through their age were not able to gain their living, his compaſſion was called upon to aſſiſt others who are ſcarce worthy to live. Theſe
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63921:83"/>
were the <hi>Gally-ſlaves,</hi> whoſe double miſery he eyed with much pitty. Comfort of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he ſuppoſed they could have little, being burdened with crimes: nor comfort of body, being loaden with chains, and exceſs of want and miſery. And yet he knew too, that to comfort the comfortleſs, be the perſon what he will, never ceaſed to be a work of mercy. He doubted not but that their crimes well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what they ſuffered, and that a juſt ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict had condemned them to no more than a condigne puniſhment in ſending them to the <hi>Gallies.</hi> Yet he conceived withal, that it was not the judges ſenſe that they ſhould periſh at <hi>Paris</hi> who were ſentenced to ſuffer at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles;</hi> and that judgment without mercy is to thoſe that ſhew not mercy. He takes then their ſad and comfortleſs condition ſeriouſly to heart. He inſtantly applies his moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſubmiſſion and ſutes to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, and the Magiſtrates, in their behalf: and obtains the old tower of St. <hi>Bernard</hi>'s Gate for their habitation, till they amount to a competent number, to be ſent away accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to cuſtome. Thus by his care are they provided of lodgings. But where muſt food be found for body and ſoul? Food for their bodies for a while iſſues out of his own and Mrs. <hi>Le Gras</hi>'s ſmall ſtock. And for their Souls the pious Prieſts of St. <hi>Nicholas de Chardennet,</hi> and his own Miſſioners plentifully furniſh.</p>
                  <p>But ſoon after the divine providence abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly provides: For a perſon of <hi>Paris</hi> of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63921:83"/>
vaſt fortune, left by his laſt Will and Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſix thouſand pounds a year forever, for the relief of thoſe miſerable creatures, whoſe deſerts could lay claim to nothing.</p>
                  <p>This plentiful fund is left under the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the <hi>Procurator general</hi> of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for perpetuity. And whereas the ſaid place of their abode was in the pariſh of St. <hi>Nicholas de Chardennet,</hi> the Curate thereof was liable to adminiſter the Sacraments unto them, and to bury their dead corps: which being a great burthen for that poor little pariſh, Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> prevailed with the Adminiſtrators to allow the ſaid Prieſts thirty Piſtols <hi>per annum</hi> out of the Fund, upon condition that they ſhould be obliged to ſay their Maſs, to exhort, catechiſe them, and perform other ſpiritual functions requiſite; which they diſcharge moſt worthily, and with very great care and charity.</p>
                  <p>Thus were the poor <hi>Gallerians</hi> well provided-for during their ſtay at <hi>Paris.</hi> And that they might likewiſe be ſo after their departure thence to <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> He (who alſo himſelf had formerly been taken upon the <hi>Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean</hi> Sea, and carryed Slave into <hi>Barbary</hi>) forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with applies himſelf to the moſt eminent Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of <hi>Richlieu,</hi> who was then General of the Gallies; and to Madam <hi>La Ducheſſe</hi> of <hi>Ayguillon,</hi> his vertuous Neece: repreſents to them the miſerable State of the <hi>Gally-ſlaves,</hi> and the extream want of an Hoſpital for them, where they might be aſſiſted in the time of their ſickneſs. Their piety procured that ſuch an
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63921:84"/>
                     <hi>Hospial</hi> was built. Here again was a houſe, but other helps were as yet wanting. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> had recourſe to the bounty of that moſt conſtantly religious <hi>Queen</hi> Regent (Mother to King <hi>Lewis</hi> the fourteenth, who now happily reigns) whoſe memory is in eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal benediction, to deal with him to become the <hi>Founder</hi> of this Hoſpital: which was done accordingly by his <hi>Letters Patents</hi> in the year 1645. and was indowed by his Majeſty with twelve hundred Piſtols.</p>
                  <p>The bleſſed effects of this royal Charity you may partly know by a Letter written to Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> by a moſt charitable Gentleman of <hi>Provence,</hi> called Mr. <hi>de la Coste,</hi> who had much contributed to that work: His Letter was as follows.</p>

                  <p>A Company of <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of good note were moved to compaſſion by the miſerable ſpectacle of poor Children, who through their parents death, or extream want, were reduced to ſuch poverty that they were ready to periſh with hunger and cold.</p>
                  <p>They repaired to the Biſhop of the place, who erected a many of them into a Confra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, to have a joint care to relieve thoſe poor Children; which pious office till this day they charitably comply with, as their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63921:85"/>
had done before them; and that ſo throughly too, that they gave theſe poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren not only their cares and pains while they were ſtrong and well able, but ſome even them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too when grown old, with all their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and ſo happily ended their days among them: and thereby it proſpered and grew up to what it now is.</p>
                  <p>The Eſtabliſhment as it was begun for the neceſſity of the poor Children of <hi>Paris,</hi> ſo it is limited to them alone; in ſuch ſort, that none can be admitted there but Children born in <hi>Paris,</hi> or the Suburbs, in lawful marriage, whoſe fathers and mothers are dead; <hi>Baſtards,</hi> and others found in the ſtreets, being exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as well by the rules of the houſe, as by the Kings <hi>Letters Pattents.</hi> Theſe poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, qualified as above, are even taken from the breaſt into this <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> where they are provided of Nurſes at the coſt thereof, and are carefully viſited and treated. As they grow up they are put to ſome Trade, as well to Maſters who reſide in the ſaid Hoſpital, as to others abroad. Such of the Boys, as they find of good wits and otherwiſe capable, are bred up in learning, and become <hi>Clergy-men:</hi> or elſe, as well they, as the Girles, are provided for in Religion at the charges of the <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> if they have a will and inclination to that holy courſe of life. The reſt are diſpoſed of to ſerve ſome perſons of quality. The boys which have learnt any trade are helped to paſs Maſters. And the Girls are aſſiſted with ſome certain
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63921:85"/>
ſumme of money to marry them. And being come to lawful age, what ever they may have brought with them is reſtored to all of them in general without limitation. They are cloathed in decent apparel of a Violet colour. There are at this day ſome two hundred in the houſe. And beſides thoſe as many as make up in all about two hundred and thirty or two hundred and forty at nurſe. To all theſe the common Charity of <hi>Paris</hi> give ſubſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Such proviſion made for the poor fatherleſs children of <hi>Paris:</hi> yet there were abundance of others in, and about the town, who had both father and mother, and remained yet in a more lamentable condition than thoſe that are deprived of them. Theſe might periſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed through want of ſuccour, yet being in their baptiſmal innocency they would be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy. Whereas theſe others by their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous and wicked parents are trained up in idleneſs, ignorance and malice, their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents own trade (made their miſerable child's portion); and by that bad art, to which they needed no Maſter, they become able cheats, cut-purſes and thieves; and ſo by that accurſed trading often gain a halter and hell to boot. The <hi>Provoſt</hi> of the Merchants and Magiſtrates were excited, by this probable occaſion of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſchief to the City, to ſtudy the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of it; and to turn a threatning miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, to a preſent mercy: Which was done as follows.</p>
                  <p>Two noble <hi>Germans,</hi> as it ſeems to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63921:86"/>
had long ago purchaſed two Acres of land near St. <hi>Deniſe</hi>'s Gate, out of a pious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to lodge poor Pilgrims, who coming weary might ſooner meet, with a lodging, than, in a manner with the town it ſelf. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they raiſed from the ground a noble fair Hall (together with ſome other buildings) of twenty one fathome and half long, ſix in breadth, and four in heighth within. This in tract of time being put to idle, impertinent and even prophane uſes, the <hi>Parliament</hi> and Magiſtrates, out of their wiſdome and charity, reſcued it out of prophaneſs, and applyed it to the work of mercy, for which it now ſerves. <hi>viz.</hi> They took all the Boys which paſſed ſeven years of age out of their poor and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly parents hands, and placed them in this <hi>Hospital;</hi> the care whereof was committed to five honeſt and able Burgeſſes, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided them of men and maids to ſerve them. As all beginnings are weak, ſo was this in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. Their ſmall beginning ſtock would hardly reach to two meals a day, till the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſome Burgeſſes added to their ſmall pittance. They are clad in blew Coats and Capps, and the place affords them food and inſtruction till they grow up to years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: and then they are bound Apprentices to certain Journey-men of divers trades; who to this purpoſe are admitted to live in certain houſes, all within the compaſs of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal for certain years, and by that means to paſs Maſters. A Priviledge which the town
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63921:86"/>
allowed of for the good of thoſe poor Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who by this means are enabled to gain their livelihood honeſtly by their labours, without being a burthen, or a miſchief to the town <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They amount at preſent to the number of one hundred and fifty.</p>

                     <head>Of the Hoſpital called the <hi>Miſericorde,</hi> or, Work of Mercy.</head>
                     <p>Monſieur <hi>Anthony Seiguier,</hi> the ſecond <hi>Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent</hi> in Parliament, was the noble <hi>Founder</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of extending it ſelf to the number of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Girls, who are plentifully provided of all things neceſſary. So that certainly this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity could not mount to leſs, all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, than to thirty or forty thouſand pounds ſterling.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place he raiſed them a fair and regular houſe from the ground, with a very decent and competent Chappel thereto ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining. The houſe conſiſts of three quarters (a body as it were and two arms); the fourth quarter being induſtriouſly left unbuilt, to receive the morning Sun, and ſo to afford a wholſome air to thoſe young children. It contains in the firſt ſtory (the lower rooms being imployed for Refectory, Work-houſe, Kitchin, Waſh-houſe and other offices) four great Chambers ſingularly well peirced and aired: in every one whereof there are twenty five iron beds, with white coverlets, each one having her bed apart.</p>
                     <p>They are modeſtly, handſomely, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomely attired in Violet cloth and decent lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63921:87"/>
and well fed. Secondly, He hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that they ſhall all of them be ſuch as want both father and mother, Natives of <hi>Paris,</hi> town or ſuburbs; begotten in lawful marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and deſtitute of all aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, They muſt be ſix or ſeven years old before they can be admitted; where they are entertained till they be twenty five (unleſs haply they have leave for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to go to ſome religious houſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires them, or to ſome good Lady, Gentile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, or Burgeſs to ſerve them, or to learn ſome trade by their means and aſſiſtance) and furniſhed with all neceſſaries. They have over each Chamber a Miſtreſs to keep good order among them, and to breed them up in vertue and all convenient works, under the conduct of a grave Governor, and learned Doctor of <hi>Sorborne,</hi> the chief Governor thereof.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Children of both Sexes being well provided-for as above, the Charity of the good Magiſtrates was called to the care of poor aged and diſtreſſed perſons, as well men as women, whoſe age and impotency hindred them to gain their living. They are divided into two quarters, the men living apart from the women. This Houſe was for the moſt part as well built as endowed by the bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Charity of Mr. <hi>Boulencour,</hi> Counſellor to the King, and <hi>Preſident</hi> of his Chamber <hi>des compts,</hi> who erected many lodgings and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for the lame and impotent <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They are furniſhed with meat, drink, and all things neceſſary, from the grand <hi>Bureaux des pauvres,</hi> as it is commonly called; which is in effect the great Court of Audience in order to works of Charity, of which I intend to make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular deſcription hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Further this Hoſpital receives poor Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, as well Boys as Girls, who have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63921:88"/>
ſcald Pates by lying in the ſtreets, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Shop-ſtalls, or otherwiſe; who are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently dreſſed, purged and frequently cured, as it hath happened to above two hundred in this place.</p>
                  <p>Here are alſo received poor Women, who are ſubject to the falling ſickneſs, as alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who are diſtracted and run up and down the ſtreets in a frantick manner; who yet by good uſage are often in length of time recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their wits. The grand <hi>Bureau de pauv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> provides this houſe with a Governor, who is at preſent a very able Surgeon; who out of his ſingular charity makes choice to dwell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt thoſe miſerable Creatures, the better to be able to aſſiſt them.</p>
                  <p>And he is ſo far from inriching himſelf by his loathſome practice, that contrarily he freely ſpends his own fortunes upon them, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king many Medicaments and compoſitions, with hopes to cure their deſperate infirmities, as it often happens; or at leaſt to ſolace their pains. This good man hath another of the ſame profeſſion, to aſſiſt him in that bleſſed imployment. He liveth near to the place, and fails not to be with them every day, or even as oft as he is called-for, to apply the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which the other provides accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his order.</p>
                  <p>And whereas this place ſerves alſo for a houſe of correction, there are two priſons to tame incorrigible perſons; and to that effect there are four Porters taken out of charity (by reaſon
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63921:89"/>
of ſome infirmity) as the reſt are, who are ordered to watch over the comportments of the poor, in point of words or actions, or any inveterate vice they may have contracted in their rude Education; and accordingly to apprehend them by the Governors direction. This is not one of the leaſt Charities of <hi>Paris,</hi> by reaſon of the ſtrange ſubjects they are to deal withal, whereof ſome through their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age need continual aſſiſtance, others in reſpect of their irregular and accidental diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes muſt always have eyes upon them: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers want wit either to aſſiſt themſelves, or to render themſelves capable of aſſiſtance with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much labour. And others finally through their rudeneſs and incorrigibleneſs deſerve no aſſiſtance at all, unleſs Charity taught Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to render good for evil, and to ſerve Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in the worſt of his members.</p>

                     <p>Was founded by that moſt incomparable Queen Regent, <hi>Anne de Auſtrice,</hi> beſtowing a Houſe and ſpacious garden upon the Inhabitants, ſituated in St. <hi>Marceaux</hi> Suburbs, and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it into a Seminary; where there are always about eighty in number. In this are ſettled a company of grave Maids; who live moſt regularly and exemplarly in ſecular ſtate, being very gravely and modeſtly attired after the manner of good widdows in the world. Their bleſſed imployment is to receive <hi>gratis,</hi> inſtruct, and direct (in order to their preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs) certain poor Maids, who are deſtitute of parents and means: and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run great hazard, to loſe that which can never afterwards be recovered; and to be put withal, together with that irreparable loſs, into the high way of perdition. Meanwhile all the other pious inventions of <hi>Paris</hi> had not reached to the prevention of this danger.

                     <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Hoſpital named <hi>la Charitie,</hi> in St. <hi>German</hi>'s Suburbs.</head>
                  <p>THis Hoſpital is governed by a company of Religious men, of the order of a Holy man called bleſſed <hi>Jean de Dieu,</hi> or <hi>John of God;</hi> the firſt Inſtituter of the ſame, under the <hi>Rule</hi> of St. <hi>Augustine.</hi> They add to the three eſſential Vows of Religion That of ſerving the ſick all their life long. The extent of their Charity goes thus far, That they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of all poor, ſick and wounded perſons of the Male Sex, without exception, ſave only ſuch as have incurable or contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
                  <p>The Hoſpital it ſelf is nobly built, well ſituated, and as neatly kept, as moſt private houſes in the town. What is wholly deputed to the uſe of the ſick conſiſts of three long Galleries or Halls; whereof the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains eighty four handſome beds, with decent curtains, and is eſpecially imployed to receive honeſt poor <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> whoſe houſe it may ſeem to be (ſo ordinarily are they lodged there.) The ſecond is furniſhed with thirty two beds, equal to the former, and it is wholly alotted for wounded men.</p>
                  <p>The third contains twenty two beds, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63921:91"/>
is for young Boys who are cut for the Stone.</p>
                  <p>As to their manner of receiving the ſick, it is full of humility and mildneſs. At their arrival one of the Religious waſhes their feet, which was the ancient and good manner of Hoſpitality. Then they are laid in a bed alone, as all the reſt are (ſave the little children) with fair clean ſheets, clean ſhirts, pillowbeers, night-caps, and a table napkin, as alſo a night gown, pantobles, a baſin to ſpit in, and a pot, and a cup to drink in. Their manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſick is to have them viſited by the Doctor every day once at leaſt, accompanied by the <hi>Infirmarian,</hi> the <hi>Apothecary,</hi> and the <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon,</hi> who orders what Phyſick they are to take, what to eat, drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſtill from three hours to three hours they take ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other to refreſh and comfort them; as new laid eggs, broth, a coulis, jelley, or comfeitures. In fine thoſe good Religious never deſert them day, nor night, but watch with them by turns.</p>
                  <p>For the good of their Souls, they are adviſed upon their firſt coming to prepare themſelves to make a general confeſſion, as the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and neceſſary remedy; God's merciful providence oft permitting our corporal ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, for the cure of our ſpiritual infirmities. Either then preſently, in caſe they be danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſick, or at leaſt the next day, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Communion, which is brought to them by the Prieſt, before Maſs, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by all the <hi>Religious,</hi> which go all
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63921:91"/>
proceſſionally (with wax candles in their hands) ſinging the <hi>Pange lingua,</hi> and <hi>veni Creator.</hi> Afterwards they hear Maſs every day, which is ſaid in the ſame place, with many other <hi>Anthems</hi> and Prayers ſung by the Religious. They are alſo taught their Chriſtian doctrine, thrice a week; and beſides that a Religious is appointed to inſtruct them more particularly in point of their Prayers, the Sacraments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Before dinner and ſupper they are ordered to ſay <hi>Pater,</hi> and <hi>Ave,</hi> for their <hi>Benefactors,</hi> while the Religious recite the Pſalm <hi>Miſerere,</hi> and <hi>De profundis;</hi> and then they waſh their hands, and hear the Bleſſing of the Table ſaid with a loud voice. When any one is dangerouſly ill, and drawing towards his Agony, all the religious are called together by ringing the Bell, and come with lighted Tapers in their hands, to ſay the Prayers appointed by the Church in ſuch circumſtances. That done there is a Religious left with them, to aſſiſt and comfort them till death. Being dead they are decently brought out and buried: all the Religious being preſent, with lighted Torches in their hands, who ſay the <hi>office for the dead,</hi> and ſing the Maſs of <hi>Requiem</hi> for the good of their Souls. And indeed all things are ſo well diſpoſed in this place, and even ſo gently, regularly and religiouſly as to all conveniences, which concern either body or ſoul, that not only good <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, perſons of great quality make choice of it in their ſickneſs. And ſome of them were ſo
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63921:92"/>
much edified with that religious treatment, that a pious Knight of <hi>England</hi> returned home ſo well ſeaſoned with the agreeable odour of that excellent Charity, which he ſaw done to any without exception, that by his laſt Will and Teſtament he bequeathed nine hundred Livres to that bleſſed place.</p>

                  <p>THis Hoſpital is called but one <hi>(Hoſpital General)</hi> but branches it ſelf into ſix vaſt places. That which bears the name, and has the Sur-intendance of all the reſt, is ſituated in St. <hi>Victor</hi>'s Suburbs (cloſe by the <hi>Abby</hi> of that name) and is known by a more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar name, our <hi>Lady's of Pitty;</hi> which the Maſters and Adminiſtrators of the place built, having to that purpoſe bought divers houſes and gardens, and alotted them all, to receive, lodge, and nouriſh poor old women and young girls, whereof there are at this hour twelve hundred and odd.</p>
                  <p>The Hoſpitals depending upon this, are the <hi>Salpetriere, Biſceſtre, Scipion,</hi> the <hi>Teigniery,</hi> and the <hi>Savonnery:</hi> In which ſix places, above eight thouſand poor Creatures are contained and maintained at preſent, by the care of the King, and the Magiſtrates, and the free and common
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63921:92"/>
Charities of all the people, which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſmall trunks or boxes, placed in Churches and Shops all the town over.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Salpetriere</hi> is far the moſt ample of all theſe places, being built from the ground in a fair and regular Quadrangle, and is capable of four or five thouſand perſons. It is finely ſituated in a Meadow by the river ſide, over againſt the <hi>Arcenal.</hi> It was eſpecially deputed to the uſe of Vagabonds and Beggars, which importuned and infeſted all <hi>Paris,</hi> whither they ſwarmed from all the Provinces. It is divided in the uſe of it into three quarters. One quarter is imployed to lodge poor fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, not otherwiſe able to live. Another for men who are obliged to work according to their abilities: And the third for little Girls even from two years old.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scipion</hi> is in St. <hi>Marceaux</hi> Suburbs, and is wholly imployed in a work of ſingular Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: <hi>viz.</hi> Poor women with child, who have not means at home to be brought to bed, are freely received there, brought to bed and lye in, being provided of Nurſes and all things fitting in ſuch a condition.</p>
                  <p>The Caſtle of <hi>Bicestre</hi> is an ancient building ſtanding a little out of St. <hi>Victor</hi>'s Suburbs. It is for thoſe who have ſtrength and ability to work. There are in it at this time about eighteen hundred men, who are kept cloſely to the exerciſe of their divers trades.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Teignery</hi> is in St. <hi>German</hi>'s Suburbs; and is imployed to keep one hundred and twenty,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63921:93"/>
who are troubled with skal'd heads. As the <hi>Savatery</hi> is alotted for the charitable enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments of ſixty poor ſickly boys.</p>
                  <p>Now as this is the thing of moſt publick and general concern of all the reſt, as being a royal Eſtabliſhment, and royally endowed by his Majeſties liberal Conceſſions in many kinds; and as the end of it is, not only to relieve the poor for the preſent, but to prevent poverty and beggary for the time to come: great Art and Induſtry is uſed, to train up the younger ſort in ſuch manufactures as may always afford them an honeſt livelihood: and others who, though ſtrong and luſty, and well able to work, yet chooſed rather to live in idleneſs, and beg their bread, are now taught and forced to gain it by their labours. Which that it might be followed without any interruption, it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by publick authority, that when any of them happens to be ſick they are tranſported to the <hi>Hoſtel Dieu,</hi> that general <hi>Refugium Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictorum</hi> which never refuſeth any. Hence it is that the greateſt Officers of his Majeſties Court of Juſtice, Magiſtrates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and take a religious concern in the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of this vaſt work, in quality of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Surviſors, having ſtore of able, honeſt, and intelligent <hi>Burgeſſes,</hi> to put in execution what by their frequent aſſemblies and confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences is found moſt conducing to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick welfare.</p>
                  <p>And no leſs care is taken for the ſpiritual advancement of thoſe lazy Vagabonds, who
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63921:93"/>
were too neglectful of their Souls good, and would willingly have loitered it out in the ſtreets and by-corners, with too probable hazard of eternal perdition; had they not been forced in, according to the Goſpel, with fair hopes to gain the day-penny of Beatitude. This care is principally left to the wiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of a <hi>Sorborn</hi> Doctor, of great learning and vertuous reputation, his name is Mr. <hi>Polier,</hi> Governor of this Hoſpital in chief, Director of the <hi>Viſitation,</hi> and of the <hi>Carmelites.</hi> He humbles himſelf to take a place, and live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe Beggars: which as it is a place of little ſplendor, ſo proves it to him of leſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument; ſave only that it affords him full utterance for ten or twelve thouſand franks a year, which he ſtood poſſeſſed of in patrimony or benefices before he embraced that dear beggarly preferment. He has the ſollicitudes of all the ſix places upon his own ſhoulders, being aſſiſted with a matter of twenty pious Prieſts, who inceſſantly under his directions preach, teach, inſtruct, comfort, confeſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here it muſt not be omitted to God's Glory, and the Honour of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Ladies of Charity, ſo-often mentioned above with deſerved commendations; That they were the firſt Movers to this vaſt work; by whom Mr. <hi>Vincent</hi> was often in their weekly charitable Aſſemblies ſollicited, yea impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned to give way to, and accompany, their zeal in that kind. But his grave counſel ſtill was, That they went too faſt a pace for him (whoſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63921:94"/>
cuſtome was to walk ſlowly) to keep com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with them. That it was a buſineſs of ſo great importance, and ſo vaſt extent, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one looked upon the manner how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs it, or the means to maintain it, that it required a long and mature deliberation. For the reſt, that he was ſingularly edified with their zeal, and infinitely bleſſed God in it. The firſt Lady that ſpoke freely offered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this great work fifty thouſand Livres.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was ready to oblige her ſelf to give three thouſand Livres annual rent. In fine they aſſured him again and again that there ſhould be no want of means, ſince many La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of their acquaintances were reſolved to contribute in a very large meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon Father <hi>Vincent</hi> had recourſe to the Queen Regent, and obtained of her free Charity the <hi>Salpebry</hi> (as he had before the Caſtle of <hi>Biſceſtre</hi>) which he and thoſe vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ladies, upon better conſideration and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, freely conſigned up into the hands of the Magiſtrates, who had not only ſtronger arms (for ſtronger and more coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious hearts they could not have) to weald ſo heavy a frame, but by their power withall they were able to call many hands to lighten the burthen. Meanwhile theſe noble Ladies threw notable ſummes into theſe ſtronger hands; not much caring by whom, ſo God's work were done. And by their own and the good Fathers care and coſt a great quantity of linnen beds, and other moveables, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>THE perfect Deſcription of this vaſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily is of a work rather to be admired, than to be expreſſed to the full. It is a Sea which ſtill ſo ebbs and flows, that it is continual high-water, ſtill a full Sea there.</p>
                  <p>Scarce a day in the year paſſes, but there are fifty, ſixty, eighty, or ſometime a hundred new Commers; and haply too a like num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber may depart to make place for their poor neighbours, whether as being recovered and ſent back to their own houſes, or dead and ſent to their graves. In a word, this Sea is ever ſo growing, and ſo grown, That twenty at leaſt, or twenty five, thouſand come and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, or dye in a years ſpace.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe of any Country, or Religion, or Age, or Sex, or ſick of whatever diſeaſe, excepting the Peſtilence (who neceſſarily are excluded

Their ordinary numbers are always vaſt; they have rarely leſs than ſeventeen, or eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, often times two thouſand, nay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they paſs three thouſand; as I was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed by one of the Doctors thereof. Yet that great <hi>Proviſor,</hi> who with five barley loaves and two fiſhes could ſatiate a far greater multitude in the wild Deſart, can when he pleaſeth, and doth in due time, open the hearts and purſes of the good <hi>Pariſians</hi> to feed thoſe huge numbers of his diſtreſſed members. And however their conſtant annual Revenues mount to an immenſe ſumme; <hi>viz.</hi> to two hundred fifty eight thouſand three hundred and thirteen Livres French, as it is ſtated by the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrators of the place, yet are they ſtill obliged to lift their hands up to their heavenly foſter father, for ſixty ſeven thouſand three hundred Livres (ſometimes leſs, ſometimes more) in common years, which yet out of his ſingular mercy never fails to riſe out of the free charity of particular perſons.</p>
                  <p>As for the firſt and principal Founders or Benefactors of this place, as it is found in the Antiquities of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the year ſix hundred and ſixty, St. <hi>Landry</hi> the twenty eighth Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the reign of King <hi>Clovis</hi> the ſecond, was the firſt who put a hand to this holy work, now called <hi>God's Houſe,</hi> where he nouriſhed the poor out of his own Revenues.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="53" facs="tcp:63921:95"/>In the year 1258 (according to <hi>Gagnin</hi>) St. <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>France</hi> imployed a great ſumme, to inlarge the ſaid Hoſpital, and to augment the Revenues thereof, as ſaith <hi>William Nangis</hi> in his life. The Chappel was built by a Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs of <hi>Paris</hi> named <hi>Gudart Mocreux,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears upon a plate of braſs in old rhimes.</p>
                  <p>In the year of our Lord 1535. Chancellor <hi>Pratte,</hi> who was afterwards Cardinal, and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate in <hi>France,</hi> made this Hoſpital be very much amplified by the addition of one ſpaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous room, which is called the Legates Hall. He gave withal a great ſubſtance to maintain the poor of the place, the Religious women who ſerve them, and the Surgeons, Doctors, and to buy Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1602. King <hi>Henry</hi> the great cauſed the great and little Hall of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> to be re-edifyed. They were begun the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid year, and were finiſhed in the year 1606. together with the three maſſy Pillars which were raiſed out of the River.</p>
                  <p>Thus by many hands and ſundry additional endeavours at divers times it grew up at length into a huge bulk; yet for all that, it was neither anſwerable to their large hearts who have the care of it, nor to the vaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the poor and needy which continually ſuper-abounds. Whereas therefore the Land could afford them no Elbow-room, the place being limited on all ſides (<hi>viz.</hi> with two ſtreets, our Ladies Church, and the river) they forced the River to afford them place by making a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63921:96"/>
bridge over the back of it, upon which they have gained a fair large and long Gallery, and by that again they diſcovered a way open to a greater inlargement: for having purchaſed a company of old buildings on the other ſide of the water, they raiſed upon their ruines a ſtately vaſt, and even a royal, quarter conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of three moſt ſpacious Halls, all of hewn ſtone. Nor are theſe and the old Halls divided by the River, but it is even it which affords a fair large Court in the middle of them; which is no leſs agreeable to the eye, than uſeful for the ſick to take the air, and to air the whole houſe. All the ancient building conſiſts of four great Halls and ſeven Offices.</p>
                  <p>The Legates Hall, and the New Hall, are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for ſick women. The Hall of women brought to bed is aſſigned for their lying in. The Hall of the Infirmary is alotted for men that are moſt ſick.</p>
                  <p>The Office of St. <hi>Deniſe</hi> is for thoſe that are wounded. The Office of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> for ſick men.</p>
                  <p>The Office belonging to Dame <hi>Prioreſs,</hi> and three other Religious, is imployed to wind the Dead.</p>

                  <p>The Office of her who keeps the Trunck and the Relicks, and dreſſes the Church for that uſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63921:96"/>The Office of the Porter is deputed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſick, to ſee them viſited, lodged and confeſſed. who is withal to give out bread and wine for them.</p>
                  <p>There is alſo an Apothecary where Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Salves and medicinal Druggs are kept in a readineſs.</p>

                  <p>There are alſo many more places for the Prieſts (who are ten conſtantly, beſides many others, who out of their particular devotion come frequently to inſtruct and comfort the ſick) and domeſtical ſervants <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as every one will eaſily conceive.

juriſdiction in this place): Theſe few Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Virgins (few I ſay compared to the vaſt numbers of the ſick) freely renouncing their own liberty, and all hopes of worldly prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to become the <hi>ſervants</hi> of the moſt poor deſpiſable ſervants of God: that I may not ſay their <hi>ſlaves,</hi> ſince a more abject and ſlaviſh life can hardly be deviſed. Whence <hi>Boteras</hi> an ancient Poet, admiring the charity and conſtancy of the ſaid Religious women, who ſerve the ſick amidſt ſo much filth and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, expreſſes himſelf in four Latine Verſes to this effect.</p>
                  <lg>
                     <l>They make themſelves the Slaves of ſick and lame,</l>
                     <l>To dreſs the loathſome ſores we ſcarce dare name,</l>
                     <l>Their Balm is Gore; their Civet, festered wounds,</l>
                     <l>Hence th' odour of their Vertue more abounds.</l>
                  </lg>
                  <p>They waſh all the clothes of thoſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of naſty goary impotent, and even too often impudent, people, even in the moſt rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cold of winter; then they ſtand in the river all the day long in great ſtiff boots, not unlike to thoſe of Fiſhermen, be it froſt or ſnow, with their Beetles in their hands, being many times all garniſhed round about their habits with Icicles.</p>
                  <p>Further they muſt every one in their turns ſerve them with their meat, drink, and all things neceſſary. They muſt turn and wind them in their bed, make the ſame, dreſs their ſcabs, and wounds <hi>&amp;c.</hi> watch them amidſt

the gaſtly horror of the night, where Death is domineering in the Hall round about them: Finally aſſiſt them dying in great numbers, wind their dead bodies, and ſend them to their Graves.</p>
                  <p>This ample Charity conceived alſo that it was not enough to relieve poor people in their ſickneſs, and to ſend them home being pretty well recovered to make place for others, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the neceſſity of the place: unleſs their Charity provided further for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture well being, and re-eſtabliſhment in their accuſtomed ſtrength and vigour; relapſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently found more dangerous than the ſickneſs it ſelf. Hereupon it was, that thoſe conſiderate perſons took a houſe not far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, where thoſe new Convaleſcents have liberty to paſs a longer time in that freſher air, and ſo wholly to confirm their ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>The Good Siſters of the <hi>Hoſtel Dieu</hi> have yet two houſes more, which depend upon their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable aſſiſtance; <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Lewis</hi> in St. <hi>Lauren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> Suburbs, a moſt ſpacious, magnificent and truly King-like Building, whoſe Majeſtical a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect ſpeaks the greatneſs of a royal <hi>Founder, Henry</hi> the Great.</p>
                  <p>And another called <hi>la Santè,</hi> a little diſtant from St. <hi>Marzeaux</hi> Suburbs. And they are both alotted to the relief of poor people, who may chance to be afflicted with the plague, whom theſe good Souls have the heroical Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to tend.</p>
                  <p>In their ordinary imploy in their <hi>Hoſtel Dieu</hi>
                     <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63921:98"/>
they freely give themſelves over to the moſt abject and ſlaviſh life imaginable. But in this they ſacrifice up themſelves to the moſt diſmal death poſſible. So that they put the higheſt rate upon their Charity that man is capable of, as is made good by our Saviour himſelf, <hi>no man hath a greater Charity than to give his life for his friends.</hi>

                     <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Hoſpital called <hi>Our Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Incurables.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THere is alſo an Hoſpital founded on ſet purpoſe for the poor <hi>Incurables;</hi> where if Chriſtian Charity cannot cure their deſperate diſeaſes, ſhe may at leaſt ſolace them in their continuing afflictions. And this bleſſed office of Chriſtianity is performed with ſo much ſweetneſs and affectionate care in this place, that thoſe poor deſolate creatures obſerving that they ſuffer not alone, but that their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt bear a part of their burthen with them by compaſſion, they ſeem to be half cured.</p>
                  <p>The illuſtrious perſon who firſt invented and founded this heavenly habitation, ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the bountiful liberalities of his pious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty <hi>Lewis</hi> the thirteenth, who freed them not onely of all duties belonging to the Crown,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63921:98"/>
but alſo gave them his Rights of Entrees of Wine <hi>&amp;c.</hi> together with a general exemption from all ſubſidies and impoſitions <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This illuſtrious Patron, I ſay, was the moſt religious and eminent Cardinal <hi>de Ruſhfaucaud,</hi> who lived, beyond the ordinary courſe of nature, to fee a good part of this deſign on foot. To which he contributed bountifully. <hi>viz.</hi> He endowed the place with a yearly rent in <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum</hi> of three thouſand and ſix hundred Franks, or three hundred and ſixty Piſtols, and laid down wherewith to build a fair Church and two Halls in the year 1637.</p>
                  <p>The place fixed upon for this moſt agreeable work was in St. <hi>German</hi>'s Suburbs, in a moſt healthful and delicious air, conſiſting of no leſs than ten acres of ground in one fair peice. There the vaſt Charity of <hi>Paris</hi> finds a large field to dilate it ſelf upon. And in very deed it ſeems it will meet with work enough for a long time, ſince, as I am told, the Deſign is to build eight or ten fair large Halls, all to be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with beds, as we ſee at preſent, with comely white fuſtian curtains, with each one a ſtraw bed, a feather bed and a good quilt, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with an Altar to every Hall, where thoſe impotent people may hear Maſs in their beds. Of all theſe deſigned Halls there are as yet only four perfected.</p>
                  <p>The excellent Adminiſtrators of the place are yearly improving the Revenues, as well by common Charities, which by their ſingular induſtry and dexterity they procure, as by
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63921:99"/>
the addition of their own means, one of them paying fifteen hundred Livres French, or one hundred and fifty Piſtols for himſelf and his man <hi>per annum,</hi> and freely contributing as much more yearly out of pure Charity, beſides three thouſand pounds which he gave the firſt year to plant and beautify the garden. So that their purely charitable and ſucceſsful labours, together with their own liberalities, heighten their hopes to ſuch a degree, that they confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently propoſe to themſelves to extend that pious foundation, which was firſt made for a dozen onely (ſix men, and ſix women) to four hundred. Nor will it be much to be doubted of (if God grant life to thoſe admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſors, in whoſe management the place now flouriſhes); ſince by their care, liberality, and proſperous endeavours they have already in a few years multiplied twelve, to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty, which are entertained at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And indeed God's Bleſſing hath already ſo viſibly appeared upon this holy foundation that ſince the year 1637, till this preſent year 1666 (the year wherein this relation was firſt publiſhed) it is augmented by the Charities of <hi>Paris,</hi> in point of buildings, to the value of five hundred thouſand french Livres, and as much more in foundation of beds, making in all a french Million, beſides ſixty thouſand Livres in annual Revenues. That part which relates to the bodily care of the Incurables, and the continual aſſiſtances which are neceſſary for thoſe poor creatures which are incapable
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63921:99"/>
in the leaſt to help themſelves, is performed by good young-men (as to the poor men) who out of Devotion ſubject themſelves to that abject imployment, taking a reaſonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration for that holy and hard ſervice. And as to the women, there are modeſt Secular Maids, who comply with the like good offices with much religion, ſweetneſs and compaſſion.</p>
                  <p>The other duty, which concerns their Souls, is abundantly diſcharged by the continual ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes of a company of moſt pious Prieſts, who live in the place, to be ready upon every call; and who are ſo abſolutely free from all ſelf intereſt that they pour out their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in that Chriſtian Service, in lieu of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together any riches thereby. Witneſs Mr. <hi>Despond</hi> the Vicar, who hath the chief charge of the Spirituality of the place, who out of his own Patrimony (in a few years that he hath lived there) hath given to the houſe above twelve thouſand Livres; with inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to leave his fair and well choſen <hi>Library,</hi> which is worth ten thouſand more, for the uſe thereof. In a word the beautiful contrivance of the whole building, the excellency of the ſituation, and the odour of the admirable Charity practiced therein, delightfully allures perſons of great worth and honour to reſide there, Abbots, Counſellors, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> Who, after they have given ample teſtimonies of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities in profitably ſerving the publick the beſt of their years, know to make a holy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat, and to ſacrifice up the honourable reſt
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63921:100"/>
of what they ſometimes were, to God along in that devout Sanctuary, where they build themſelves noble quarters during their lives, to be left to the Hoſpital as Monuments of their Piety after their deaths.</p>
                  <p>Moſt worthily may be added to theſe that moſt famous Biſhop of <hi>Beſlay,</hi> that Lover of the poor and poverty, which he truly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; for tho he did not actually live with them, yet did his affection and approbation always accompany them, his ambition, as he oft ſaid, never going higher than to be reputed a poor <hi>Chaplain</hi> of that holy family: Hence he left them what he had, and the relicks of what he had been to be interred in their Church. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcat in pace.</hi>

                  <p>THere are many other excellent works of Charity exerciſed in <hi>Paris.</hi> As in that Hoſpital of the <hi>Racquet</hi> in the Suburbs of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, which depends on another in the Town behind the <hi>Place Royal;</hi> governed by a company of good <hi>Nuns</hi> of St. <hi>Augustine</hi>'s Order, who receive a many good <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> in their infirmities and incommodities, and treat them with much charity and goodneſs, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63921:100"/>
them handſome beds, good diet, and all things neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>There are other two houſes; effects of the late Charities of <hi>Paris:</hi> the one for men, and the other for women newly converted.</p>
                  <p>The firſt in St. <hi>Victor</hi>'s Suburbs; the other near St. <hi>Euſtache</hi>'s. They are taken in, and maintained <hi>gratis</hi> for three months ſpace at leaſt, to be thoroughly inſtructed and conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled in the truth.</p>
                  <p>God ſo bleſſed the pious endeavours of a good Lady called Madam <hi>D'Estang,</hi> among the good people of <hi>Paris,</hi> That ſhe has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured ſubſiſtance for two hundred and fifty poor young Maids (which her care hath ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together); who by her grave prudence are modeſtly and chriſtianly bred, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully kept out of harms way; to which that Sex and thoſe green years are but too incident.</p>
                  <p>Multitudes of Girls are taught (for meer Charity) to ſerve God, to read, to write, to work divers kinds of work, whereby they are enabled to become good Houſewifes at home, or to gain their liveli-hood among the Merchants: Taught as well in Religious houſes, eſpecially the <hi>

                  <p>To conclude, poor diſtreſſed people of the general Hoſpital, the otherwiſe deſerted Gally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaves, and the deſolate Priſoners, often expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

the comfortable viſits of the nobleſt Ladies of <hi>Paris:</hi> who ſolace the firſt with their affable and pious Diſcourſe; and oftentimes deliver the later by paying the ſumme for which they were impriſoned.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt principal of pious Works being, the building Churches for God's pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service, and houſes of Religious, by whom he may be more conſtantly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all ſecular diſtractions, adored. The City of <hi>Paris</hi> for theſe is much renowned, the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick <hi>Piety</hi> of which in thirty years ſpace hath produced at leaſt forty conſiderable Churches and Chappels with fair Monaſteries to the moſt of them.</p>

                     <p>Now if thus much be ſaid for the <hi>Piety</hi> which appears in the Walls, what might not juſtly be ſaid for the religious lives of the heavenly Inhabitants? Who endeavouring to follow the Evangelical Counſels (which certainly were not given by Wiſdome it ſelf to fall fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the ground; to be neglected by all men,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63921:102"/>
to be imitated by none;) of a more perfect way of life than the meer keeping the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments (as theſe oblige all men under pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty of ſin) went and ſold, or abandoned, all that they had, and all that they could hope for in this world (to become thereby the poor of Chriſt, and take up their Croſs, that is a penitential life) gave it to the poor, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him; by imitating his divine, chaſtity, poverty and obedience, as far forth as by his grace they are capable thereof. Who have but one heart and one ſoul in our Lord, one common habitation, one purſe, one pantery, and live at ſuch a diſtance from any real propriety, that theſe cold words, <hi>Meum &amp; Tuum,</hi> Mine and Thine (the ſourſe of all diſſentions) are baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of their Society. Whoſe whole appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as well by profeſſion as practice, is to God and godly Studies; whoſe exerciſe is to pray and ſing heavenly Pſalms, Hymns, and Canticles, before the throne of God, day and night; in a word, whoſe Converſation is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in Heaven.</p>
